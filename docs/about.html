    <h3>About the New Jersey State<br id="break"> Office of Innovation</h3>
    <p>The New Jersey State Office of Innovation was created by Governor Phil Murphy in August, 2018 with the
      appointment of Dr. Beth Simone Noveck as the State's first-ever Chief Innovation Officer.</p>
    <p>Founded with the mandate to improve the lives of New Jerseyans by designing and deploying more effective and
      efficient government services, the Office of Innovation works in partnership with the Governor’s
      Office and State agencies to create innovative policies and technologies that address complex public problems by
      working differently: we apply data science and public engagement to understand problems, and use
      modern digital technologies combined with strategic policies to develop solutions that improve services while
      also reducing costs for the State and the taxpaying public. </p>
  </div>
  <div style="padding-bottom: 0;margin-bottom:0" class="projects list">

    <h3 style="padding-top: 3rem; ">How We Work + What We Do</h3>
    <p>The Office of Innovation works collaboratively with government, academic, non-profit, and private sector
      institutions to drive innovation in the Garden State's economy and improve the design and delivery of policies and
      services
      to the State's residents, businesses, and institutions.</p>

        <h4>Design + Development</h4>

        <p>Through the Innovation Lab, the Office of Innovation partners with State departments on product and project
          development. Under this model, the Office deploys
          interdisciplinary teams to embed within - or across - departments to deliver new products, policies, or
          programs. The Innovation Lab utilizes agile
          methodologies, working closely with agency and project management team leadership, to efficiently and
          iteratively develop, test, and implement
          solutions to public problems.

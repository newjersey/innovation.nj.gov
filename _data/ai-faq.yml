  question: |
    Can I enter PII into publicly available AI Assistants like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini?
  answer: |
    No. PII may only be entered into AI tools under state licenses that include proper privacy protections: data is securely stored and never shared with external parties. Examples of approved tools are listed under "State-Approved AI Tools and Approval Process." If you're not sure whether a given tool complies, ask your CIO.

  question: |
    How do I access the Generative AI Training Program?
  answer: |
    Government employees, contractors, and those with access to the State's Learning Management System may access the Generative AI Training Program. Access this course [as a State Learner](https://stateofnewjersey.sabacloud.com/Saba/Web_spf/NA9P2PRD001/common/ledetail/CLIP.RAIPP.WBT/latestversion) or [as an External Learner](https://stateofnewjersey-external.sabacloud.com/Saba/Web_spf/NA9P2PRD001/common/ledetail/CLIP.RAIPP.WBT/latestversion). You will be asked to log in with MyNJ and then redirected to the training. If you have trouble accessing the course, please email [clipelearning.support@csc.nj.gov](mailto:clipelearning.support@csc.nj.gov).

  question: |
    How do I review AI-generated content before publishing?
  answer: |
    AI-generated content should be reviewed for accuracy and content whenever possible. We recommend a review process that covers five common issues with AI-generated content.

    1. Accuracy: check the generated content for accuracy of facts and figures. Verify numbers, names, dates, addresses, URLs, cited sources, etc. If there is technical content that requires expert review, ensure that a subject matter expert is brought in for this verification. Remember that AI tools can often “hallucinate” false information that looks convincing, so it is important to be thorough.
    2. Bias: generative AI systems are trained using decades of human-generated text, and can often inherit the biases present in this data. For example, AI systems [sometimes assume](https://www.unwomen.org/en/news-stories/explainer/2024/05/artificial-intelligence-and-gender-equality) that doctors are male and nurses are female. Ensure that the content is accessible to all cultural backgrounds, uses inclusive language, and does not include prejudice based on race, gender, or other protected statuses. 
    3. Completeness: AI systems can often miss key points when summarizing and synthesizing information. It is good practice to check through the source material and ensure that the generated content includes all of the main points and any necessary context. Consider the AI-generated content from the perspective of its intended audience: is any information missing that may be obvious to you, but that your audience may not be aware of?
    4. Accessibility and Style: AI-generated content should be held to the same quality and style standards as human-generated content, including brevity, tone, and accessibility. If your organization has content standards, such as a standard reading level that all content should fall within or a specific level of formality, ensure that the AI-generated content adheres to these standards. Note that these standards can be inserted into prompts to AI systems to improve results. For example: “Summarize this document. Ensure that the summary is at a 5th grade reading level or below.” Even when inserted into the prompt, instructions might not be followed; it is still important to review!

  question: |
    Are there any general tips & tricks to using Generative AI?
  answer: |
    Generative AI can be used for drafting, revising language (try indicating the reading level of the intended audience), translation, summarization, data analysis, and generating code, images, audio, and video.

    1. **Ask, early and often.** Experiment with multiple approaches to asking a question or giving an instruction, and compare results.
    2. **Carefully evaluate outputs.** Ensure that outputs are reviewed for factual accuracy and effectiveness at the intended task.
    3. **Give clear, concise instructions.** The following can increase effectiveness:
        - assigning the AI assistant a well-defined role,
        - being specific with your requests
        - providing specific instructions for the format and contents of the output (e.g. "8th grade reading level", "one-page summary with the following sections: ...")
        - providing examples of the end result you want to see
    4. **Provide adequate context.** Providing context will typically improve accuracy and reliability. Large language models (LLMs) are trained on vast quantities of information, but do not have updated information, or access to specific data or content specific to your organization or project. When asking specific questions, paste relevant context, separated by a clear denotation such as “base your answer on the following [context document title]:...”
    5. **Use special prompting strategies for complex tasks.** Strategies such as providing examples of desired inputs and outputs, multi-step reasoning (chain-of-thought prompting), comparing the output of multiple prompts, or providing the prompt and its resulting output to the Assistant and asking it to improve the prompt—called meta prompting.
    6. **Employ intentional evaluation techniques to complex or repeated tasks.** Measure the accuracy and completeness of AI-generated content using a well-defined methodology when applying AI systems to complex tasks or tasks with large-scale output, to ensure that AI-generated products that are not reviewable manually can still be validated.

**WASHINGTON D.C.** - New Jersey State Chief Innovation Officer and Chief AI Strategist Beth Simone Noveck delivered testimony yesterday to the United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs that focused on how to harness AI to improve government services and customer service. 

The Chief Innovation Officer’s testimony comes on the heels of an array of AI-related announcements from Governor Murphy, including the [creation of an AI Task Force](https://www.nj.gov/governor/news/news/562023/20231010b.shtml), a [government use policy and training program on AI](https://www.nj.gov/governor/news/news/562023/20231117a.shtml), the [pending creation of an AI hub in Princeton](https://www.nj.gov/governor/news/news/562023/20231218a.shtml), and a New Jersey AI Moonshot to pioneer a series of AI-powered breakthroughs over the next decade in the Garden State.

“These remarkable technologies for organizing information could hold the key to designing better institutions, capable of listening and learning more efficiently, and responding more effectively to the challenges of our times,” said Noveck in her testimony. “If we want to realize the benefits of these powerful technologies for improving governance, strengthening resident engagement, and deepening democracy, we must invest more in creating that future.”

The testimony laid out a series of 12 recommendations that the Federal government can undertake to utilize AI to improve service delivery and customer service, ranging from implementing AI systems to provide 24/7 customer information services and more intuitive access to information across government departments, to training public sector workers on practical applications of AI in government services and integrating responsible AI systems with human oversight to support government workers.

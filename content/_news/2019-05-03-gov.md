TRENTON - As Governor Phil Murphy continues working to bolster New Jerseyâ€™s innovation economy, he signed legislation today (S731) that outlines regulations governing the use of low speed electric scooters and e-bikes. The bill calls for motorized scooters and e-bikes capable of traveling 20 miles per hour or slower to be regulated much the same as ordinary bicycles, allowing their operation on streets, highways, and bicycle paths in this State.

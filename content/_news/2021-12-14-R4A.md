At a virtual event co-hosted by the National Governors Association (NGA), New Jersey was highlighted by Results for America as a honor roll state in using evidence and data to deliver better results for New Jerseyans.

Results for America, a national nonprofit that promotes evidence-based policymaking, released the 2021 Invest in What Works State Standard of Excellence, an annual report that assesses how states across the country are building and using data and evidence to drive budget, policy, and management decisions.

Human Services Commissioner Sarah Adelman and Chief Innovation Officer Dave Cole announced the launch of the Disability Information Hub during an event commemorating Disability Pride Month and the 34th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA Day). The Hub will serve as a one-stop shop to connect New Jerseyans with disabilities, their families, caregivers, and advocates with state services and resources in an accessible format.

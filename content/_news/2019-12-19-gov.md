TRENTON - Governor Phil Murphy today announced five winning teams of the Innovation ENJINE Challenge, an open innovation competition launched this spring to elicit State employees’ unique perspectives and ideas to make government more effective and efficient. The ENJINE Challenge -- which is part of the State’s SmarterNJ initiative focused on creating new and innovative ways for the public to contribute meaningfully to the policymaking process -- is also among the first of the Governor’s and Chief Innovation Officer Beth Simone Noveck’s efforts to encourage innovative public problem-solving and advance public entrepreneurship in New Jersey.

TRENTON - New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy on Wednesday shared new models developed by the Department of Health and Office of Innovation that attempt to forecast the next several weeks of the coronavirus pandemic.

Two models looked at the worst-case scenario where there is no change in current mask compliance, social distancing and gatherings.

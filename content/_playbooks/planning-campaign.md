Pull together your defined strategies and validated messaging to create specific tactics to reach, activate, and optimize audiences using media placements, creative execution, data collection, and reporting.

Develop the plans, assets, and infrastructure that will be implemented during Production. Development includes Media Planning, Partnership Development, Creative Development, and Tracking & Reporting planning.

Activities include the identification of recommended media partners, placements and costs; applying the winning creative concept to all required creative formats ("treatments") for review and approval, and aligning tracking and reporting requirements.

Everything developed in this phase will be executed during Production.

## Why it matters

These tactical elements serve as your campaign's infrastructure.

## How it works

Four campaign components happen in parallel:

### 1. Paid Media Planning

Using the strategic approach and media channels defined in your Communication Strategy, a detailed "Media Plan" is developed. The Media Plan details how long your campaign will run, the specific partners and placements you will use, and the creative assets that are required.

If your campaign has funds available to spend on paid media, how those funds are allocated will be defined in the Plan.

For all media placements, creative production specifications ("specs") are gathered and added to the Creative Brief. This information will be used during Production.

### 2. Partnership Development

Most organizations have relationships with a network of partners and community based organizations. These partners serve the same constituents as you do and are a great resource to help amplify your marketing message.

Develop a list of potential partners and conduct outreach to understand partner/CBO willingness and ability to support your campaign, their required timing, and the formats and assets they can use.

            It is not unusual for 20% of the partners to generate 80% of Partner activity. Sometimes you have to do a wide test to identify who will generate the most volume but, if you have a good sense up front who that will be, consider focusing initial efforts on the top providers and then expand to more Partners over time.

### 3. Creative Development

The final creative concept (identified in Creative Concept/Validation phases) will now be translated into different formats based on what is required by your Media Plan. That could include translating it into billboards, banners, social ads, emails, radio spots, etc.

It could also include landing pages or a microsite that captures traffic from your campaign and focuses your audience on taking the desired action (such as registering for a program).

By using the winning creative concept as the foundation for all campaign creative assets, you will ensure your audience experiences a consistent message and experience across touchpoints.

Remember that the more things you try to communicate in an ad, the less anyone will remember. Each creative asset only needs to do one thing - help nudge your audience forward in their journey. The individual creative assets work together to tell a complete story. No single asset should be expected to do or say everything.

### 4. Data, Tracking, & Reporting

Before diving into setting up campaign tracking and reporting, it’s important to take a big step back and remind yourself of your campaign’s overarching goal - what is it you are trying to achieve? Because your ultimate goal should determine what is being reported on and, in turn, what is being tracked.

This process is very straightforward. During Discovery you did the hard work of aligning on your marketing goals, and the metrics you will use to evaluate your success in achieving them. The metrics you defined support your campaign’s marketing goals and will be the north star of your campaign’s tracking and reporting development, informing:

- **Campaign "actions" that need to be tracked.** Based on your campaign’s marketing goals, what are the actions you are asking your audience to take? Is it to visit a website, register for a program, call a phone number? Whatever the action that you are asking your audience to take, and that has been identified as a "metric for success," will need to be tracked and tied back to your campaign’s activity.

  There are many website analytics platforms that can be used to track digital activity, and they don’t have to cost a lot of money. The OOI uses GA4 for our campaigns as it is relatively easy to use and the free version supports basic analytics needs.

- **How campaign performance data is set up and delivered.** A campaign performance dashboard should make it easy for you to see at a glance how your campaign is performing against your goals and tell you a story about what is driving the performance. Take that big step back and ask yourself: if the report could only tell me one thing, what would that be? That is where your report starts.

  As an example, if your marketing goal is to increase registrations to your program vs. the year before, your report would start with that number: a year over year percent increase. That could be followed by the total number of registrations generated that month, then a channel breakdown of where the registrations were coming from, and perhaps a look at the creative assets there were generating registrations.

  Traditional detailed campaign performance reporting is still critical as a mechanism to understand (and optimize) the tactics that are driving performance against campaign goals.

- **Campaign optimization.** If you are using paid digital media, chances are it’s being automatically optimized based on your campaign’s defined goals. That means it is critical that you are tracking the right "actions" (a visit, a click on specific content, registration, sign-up, etc.) and that the tracking has been tested and validated as working correctly. When the goals, metrics, and tracking align, your campaign will automatically optimize to generate the highest number of desired actions at the lowest possible cost.

## How long it takes

3-4 weeks.

Media Planning, Creative Development and Data, Tracking & Reporting can happen in parallel.

Often this work can be done as quickly as 2 weeks. However, if you are building out a new digital experience (website or landing page) the Data, Tracking & Reporting work may take a bit longer depending on how far along the digital experience planning and production is.

If you are in a time crunch, identify which creative assets need to go first and prioritize their build. That way, you can launch with the most important placements/assets first and rollout with everything else as soon as available.

## Do it in a day

Focus on channels and assets that require very little lead time such as paid search, social (paid ads as well as your own social presence) and your email list to develop a quick plan and creative treatments within a day.

## Outputs

- Updated Creative Brief
- Media Plan (create stripped down version)
- Data & Reporting Requirements (will have to find something for this)

Objectives and strategies are brought to life with messaging and imagery.

Develop "creative concepts" that fulfill the campaign objectives and creative strategies defined in the Creative Brief.

Creative concepts typically consist of some sample copy (such as a headline, call to action, and text) plus imagery (often several photos, illustrations, or other imagery that conveys the emotion the concept is supposed to elicit) that work to bring the idea in the concept to life.

Activities include "ideation" (time dedicated to coming up with creative execution ideas, refining them and rejecting the ones that don’t work) and the presentation of the concepts to the team’s stakeholders.

Based on stakeholder input, the number of concept options are narrowed down and feedback is incorporated. The final approved creative concepts will be quantitatively tested in Creative Concept Validation.

## Why it matters

Good creative execution will activate your audience and move them to action. Poor creative execution will be ignored by your audience and limit your ability to create impact where it is needed most.

## How it works

Using the Creative Brief developed during the Definition phase, your creative team (copywriter + art director) and/or consultants work together to brainstorm "creative concepts" - which are ideas to capture our audience’s attention with a story that provokes an emotional reaction and moves them to action.

Creative concepts typically consist of some sample copy (such as a headline, call to action, and text) plus imagery (often several photos, illustrations, or other imagery that conveys the emotion the concept is supposed to elicit) that work to bring the idea in the concept to life.

Ideally, you’ll develop a minimum of 3-4 concepts. Each concept should offer a different approach and creative idea. It’s important to have a variety of options because it makes it easier to identify what you like and don’t like, and you may find elements across the individual concepts that you want to draw from.

You’ll then share the concepts with your project stakeholders for their feedback. Feedback from your stakeholders should focus on strategic direction (i.e., can we dial up the emotion, can the call to action be made more prominent, etc). While it’s tempting to give executional feedback (i.e., change the headline to blue because I don’t like green) it’s important to let the creative team handle these details.

Concepts are narrowed down - you won’t want to test more than three or four.. If you’re not able to test your creative concepts, you’ll need to select one to move forward with .

Before moving the concepts into validation, you should consider if you want to test the concepts as presented with visuals + copy or if they should be further developed into :30 scripts. If your campaign is taking a "video-first" approach, where video will be the lead creative asset and used across multiple channels and formats (such as TV, streaming, paid social, on websites/microsites, and in emails), you will get the best learning with a script.

## How long it takes

1 - 3 weeks.

Good ideas can happen in a few minutes or take some time to ferment.

If possible, it’s good to give your creative team time to develop their ideas, especially if your message is especially complicated or nuanced.

Don’t forget to allocate time for feedback and remember, the more you "noodle" with the work with repeated small changes that don’t impact the quality of the work, the longer it will take to finalize your creative concepts.

## Do it in a day

Ideation can be time-boxed. Give your team a day and see what they come up with.

While this isn’t recommended for a campaign that will be running for a while and has a significant media budget, it will absolutely work for quick-turnaround projects and/or one-off efforts.

            If you don’t have a creative team, it is highly recommended you find an experienced creative resource to do this work (see <a href="{% link _playbooks/kick-off.md %}">Kick-off</a> meeting).

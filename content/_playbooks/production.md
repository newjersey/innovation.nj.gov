Up until now, you have been learning, strategizing, and developing tactics. With Production you shift gears and start "building" your campaign - everything from producing creative assets and ordering media placements to implementing tracking and setting up reports.

## Why It Matters

Well planned, organized execution drives successful campaign performance.

## How it Works

### 1. Creative Production

Your final Media Plan aligned on in Development will determine what and how many creative assets are needed to support the planned placements. Depending on your timeline and budget, you might produce your creative assets using "stock art" (licensed photography, illustrations, music, animations, etc.) or you might produce your assets from scratch at a "shoot" where you secure original video footage and photography stills.

At the Office of Innovation, our campaigns often take a video first approach that features real residents. Using video production as our starting point, we layer on still photography and use the shoot to secure enough assets to produce all creative deliverables required by the campaign. The assets secured at the shoot create a "treasure chest" that can be drawn from to produce new assets whenever the need arises. The assets can even be used for other program communication initiatives.

            There is an old advertising saying, which is that every client wants three things: fast, cheap, and good. Reality is they need to pick two. <br />
            As with everything else, decisions often require tradeoffs. This is especially true when it comes to creative production. If you want something done on a super tight timeline you will need to spend more to maintain the quality of production or be prepared to pull back your expectations.
            <br/>Conversely, if you have the luxury of time, you can often use it to plan a production that costs less but still delivers the same level of quality.

            Don’t forget to QA all creative assets before they are final products. This should include having someone unfamiliar with the messaging read through all finalized copy to find any remaining typos.

### 2. Media Buying

Many organizations use vendors to execute their paid media campaigns, especially if their budgets are large. But if your budget is smaller and your team has capacity, you might want to keep this work "in-house." There are two ways you can buy and manage paid media: - **Self Service.** Many digital platforms including Google, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, etc., are "self service." This means you will need to create an advertising account on their platform and use a credit card to pay for the media. For most self service platforms, there are no minimum spend or length of time requirements. You can run a campaign for as little and long as you want. - **Professional Services.** The more traditional advertising model involves being assigned an account representative who will plan and optimize your campaign for you. These engagements involve larger commitments (both time and money) - both of which can be negotiated. The campaigns are run based on "insertion order," meaning you have negotiated payment terms and are sent an invoice each month after the prior month’s activity closes out.

        <h3 class="usa-alert__heading">Pro Tip</h3>
        <p class="usa-alert__text">
            If you plan on using Facebook or Instagram, make sure you have a "brand page" set up and request verification at least 4-6 weeks before planned launch. Social media platforms including Meta (Facebook and Instagram) and YouTube require advertisers to have a "brand page" on their platform in order to run paid media. Facebook has a page verification process that can take up to 40 days to complete.

### 3. Tracking Implementation

There are two types of tracking that need to be implemented to support your marketing campaign. - **UTM Tracking.** A UTM code (UTM stands for Urchin Tracking Module - which originates from a discontinued software platform purchased by Google in 2005) or parameter identifies successrmation about your marketing activity. It’s a snippet of text that gets added to the end of a URL to create a "trafficking URL." The UTM code can contain up to five parameters: Campaign, source, medium, content, and term. You can use our [UTM generator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rZO3ea0e5wyNHpFPY6L3r3Cc9CfZ44-KsPkaYtmf0TA/edit?usp=sharing) to create your own trafficking URLs. UTMs can be used to track both Partner and Paid Media activity. - **Tracking Pixel.** A tracking pixel is an invisible javascript code that lives on a website or email. Paid media vendors often require their proprietary pixel be installed on your website for the campaign to be run (this includes Facebook, Instagram, ad serving platforms and all programmatic media vendors). That’s because the pixel collects successrmation about visitor actions on your website and automatically optimizes performance based on the action taken (or not taken). Pixels are required for conversion-optimization and retargeting campaigns.

<div class="usa-alert usa-alert--success margin-top-5">
<div class="usa-alert__body">
    <h3 class="usa-alert__heading">Pro Tip</h3>
    <p class="usa-alert__text">
            Tracking pixels should be implemented at least two weeks before a campaign goes live or, better yet, four weeks in advance. That’s because pixels collect data on the characteristics of your site’s visitors so, when you launch, your media vendors can target similar audiences. That sets your campaign up for success out of the gate. <br />

            Without advance data collection, you will be spending money blindly for the first few weeks of the campaign while enough data can be collected to start profiling and targeting the right audience for your program.

<div class="usa-alert__body">
    <h3 class="usa-alert__heading">Red Flag</h3>
    <p class="usa-alert__text">
            It is imperative that tracking implementation be thoroughly QA’d before a campaign goes live. Click on a representative sample of UTMs and take all the actions you are tracking (visit a page, register on the site, sign up for a newsletter, etc.) and look at the data to confirm what is reported aligns with the actions taken. <br />

            The process to QA pixel-based tracking will be a bit different. If you are running your campaign through a professional services engagement, your partner will work with you to QA the tracking implementation. If you are working with a self-serve platform that requires a pixel (such as Facebook), you will need to put the campaign live first (can do it for a very small amount) to double check everything is working properly.

### 4. Dashboard & Reporting Set-up

Regardless of how you are tracking your campaign, you should be able to access real-time performance reports directly from your tracking and reporting interface.

Many analytics platforms come with pre-built marketing reports that can be customized, or they might give you the option of creating your own from-scratch views. This is also true for self-service media platforms including Meta (Facebook/Instagram) and Google Ads (paid search, YouTube, display, etc.)

The important thing is to do the work of looking at what’s available and customizing the views BEFORE the campaign goes live so you are ready to hit the ground running with the launch.

    <div class="usa-alert__body">
        <h3 class="usa-alert__heading">Pro Tip</h3>
        <p class="usa-alert__text">
                Don’t forget to report on view-through activity! "View-through" means someone saw your ad but went to your website without clicking on it. If you only look at click-based data you miss out on gaining insight into the full impact your marketing campaign has at influencing traffic and on-site actions.

### 5. Trafficking

"Trafficking" a campaign means sending out detailed instructions and creative assets to your partners, and uploading everything into self-service platforms. There are two tools that manage this work: - **Creative Matrix.** A master workbook that specifies every media channel, site, placement, size, message and related creative asset. The more detailed the successrmation in the Matrix, the more flexibility it will give you when you run performance reports. See example Creative Matrix here. - **Trafficking Instructions.** A document that organizes placement and creative asset successrmation for your partner to implement. It should make it as easy as possible for anyone to pick up and be able to clearly understand what happens next. See example Trafficking Instructions here.

### 6. Pre-Launch Checklist

Here is a handy checklist to make sure all tasks are done and requirements in order before your campaign is pushed live:

## How Long it Takes

4-6 weeks.

Similar to the Development phase, there are Production components that can happen in parallel (Creative Production and Media Buying). Tracking Implementation can also happen in parallel if the campaign will be driving traffic to an existing digital presence. If you are building out a new presence (website, microsite or landing page), Tracking Implementation can start as soon as the instance is live.

## Do it in a Day

Focus on a single channel like paid search and paid social and develop a very limited campaign. Campaigns on these platforms can be launched within a matter of seconds and optimized based on website visits.

In parallel, continue to implement tracking, develop more assets, etc. and roll out with them as soon as they are ready.

## Outputs

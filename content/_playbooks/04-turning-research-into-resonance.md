title: "Turning Research Into Resonance"

Now it's time to make sense of what you collected in your research and heard in interviews. This includes identifying the "critical insight" that brings to life what really matters most to your audience, and turning it into a statement that answers your audience's ultimate question: "what's in it for me?" This work becomes the foundation for creative ideation and messaging, as well as an overall strategic approach that meets people where they are in their journey.

## Why it matters

This is how we surface and document what matters most to our audience. It helps us make sure we are talking to people about the things they actually care about and what will motivate them to act, instead of focusing on what we think they need to know. Without this step, strategy is often built around program goals rather than audience needs. This work helps close that gap.

## How it works

Boiling down your research into a strategic foundation happens in two steps:

### 1. Identify your critical insight

A "critical insight" is a concise, audience-centered idea that reveals an emotionally grounded truth. It is often surprising and reframes our understanding, explaining why people act (or don't), and inspires messaging or strategy that truly resonates.

A good critical insight is:

- **Audience-centered:** Focuses on what matters to the people you want to reach, not what your program delivers.
- **Emotionally grounded:** Connects to real feelings, not just surface-level facts or observations.
- **Revealing or surprising:** Brings a fresh perspective or uncovers a truth that reframes how you see the problem.
- **Actionable:** Points clearly toward how to communicate, design, or deliver in a way that meets people where they are - which means putting the right message, delivered in the right format, in the right place, and at the right time in their journey.
- **Obvious after the fact:** A strong insight often feels instantly true once named, even if it wasn't clear before.

Sometimes a critical insight jumps out at you during an audience interview the moment you hear a respondent say it (i.e., "It's like you are grieving" or "free money is nice but it's not the same thing as having a thriving business").

If that doesn't happen, you just need to do a bit of leg work to uncover it. Start by reviewing your interview notes and look for patterns. What aspirations came up more than once? What hopes, fears, or motivations might be behind what people said? What is the ultimate progress your audience is trying to make?

Use the [Audience Insight Canvas](/assets/cel/toolkit/audience-insight-canvas-r4.pdf){:target="\_blank"} to organize what you heard and begin to interpret what it might mean. Then identify one critical insight--a clear, meaningful sentence that captures what your audience is really feeling or experiencing. This can either be a sentence literally said by a respondent in an interview, pulled from an article or research paper, or a statement you craft to bring the identified insight to life. This becomes the anchor for your strategy and communication.

        <ul>
            <li>
                A good critical insight gets to the heart of what matters and feels obvious after you've identified it. (<em>"Working helps me feel better about myself. It's not about the money. It gives me a sense of purpose. Like I really get to do something with my life."</em>)
            </li>
            <li>
                It's possible research could confirm (or not confirm) things you've wondered about. If you don't hear anything surprising it could mean that your questions were leading or resulting in specific responses about your original theories, instead of really probing into your audience.If you aren't finding yourself with those kinds of results, look at your questions and see if they need some adjustment.
            </li>
            <li>
                If your insight doesn't shift how you see your audience, or doesn't make someone on your team say "yes, that's it," keep going. You're not just summarizing, you're discovering the why that makes everything else clearer.

        <ul>
            <li>
                Your critical insight is a restated quote or summary, it doesn't convey a deeper understanding of what motivates your audience.
            </li>
            <li>
                Your critical insight speaks to operations (i.e., people are observed to hover over one part of your website, or they are submitting resumes but not getting any interviews) instead of emotions, motivations or aspirations (i.e., they want a job where they feel like they are helping people).
            </li>
        </ul>

### 2. Develop your "what's in it for me" statement

Your newly identified critical insight becomes the North Star to fulfill with your "value proposition" statement. Writing this statement will help you make a clear and compelling case for why your program matters to the people you're trying to reach, answer their ultimate question ("what's in it for me?") and guide how you talk about it in ways that are motivating, not just informational.

A strong value proposition does more than describe your program or service. It reflects your audience's real experiences, connects to what they care about, and speaks to the progress they want to make in their lives. When done well, it helps your team communicate in ways that are human, relevant, and motivating, not just informational.

A good value proposition statement will:

- Lead with what matters to your audience, not what you want to promote.
- Reflect your audience's goals, needs, and lived experience.
- Create a clear bridge between the transformation, relief or opportunity your initiative offers and the progress your audience is trying to make.
- Feel like something real people would care about, not a slogan or a jargony mission statement.
- Serve as a foundation for your "what's in it for me" messaging, keeping your messaging focused on your audience's priorities.

#### Building blocks of a strong "what's in it for me" statement

Your statement should combine five key parts. Together, they help you connect both the practical benefit and the deeper emotional payoff:

1.  **Audience (Who is this for?)**

    Ground your statement in the people you want to reach. Be specific.

    _Example: For new parents, veterans returning to work, small business owners in rural areas_

    <br/>

2.  **Progress they are trying to make (What shift are they working toward?)**

    What are they hoping to change, overcome, or improve? This is about meaningful progress, not just solving a surface problem. It is about helping people achieve the vision they have for their lives.

    _Example: buy a house with a yard their kids can run around in, run a successful business, secure a job that gives they can feel a sense of purpose_

    <br/>

3.  **Your program, product, or service (What are you offering?)**

    Describe what your initiative provides, simply and clearly.

    _Example: free job training, subsidized transit pass, mental health support hotline_

    <br/>

4.  **Benefits (What does it help them do or access?)**

    Focus on the practical outcome. How does your offering remove barriers, create access, or provide real help?

    _Example: gain new skills to secure a higher paying job, get to work on time without a car, talk to a live person to help you get the support you need_

    <br/>

5.  **What's in it for me (What is the deeper emotional or personal payoff?)**

    This is where your insight connects to motivation. It is not just about a quick fix or temporary benefit. It is about the lasting change that helps people live according to their values, show up for others, or unlock a better version of their life. In advertising, this is often called the end-end benefit.

    _Example: be a role model for your kids, have financial stability, make impact in your community, keep working until retirement_

    <br/>

When you combine these parts, you create a message that centers your audience, connects to their reality, and makes a clear, human case for why your initiative matters.

Example statement:

_For new parents who are trying to return to work after having a child, our free job training program helps you gain the skills you need to land a higher paying job that will provide financial stability for you and your family._

Use our [Value Proposition Generator](/assets/cel/toolkit/value-proposition-generator.pdf){:target="\_blank"} to draft a statement that reflects what your audience will get out of your program and why that matters to them. Focus on the ultimate progress people are trying to make, not just the features of your program. Remember, it's never about the program or service, it's always about what the program or service will help people do.

                If your value proposition could apply to any program, it's too vague. Make it specific to what your audience values most.

                Read your draft out loud. If it sounds like something a real person would say, you're on the right track.

            <li>
                You're using internal language, acronyms or policy terms instead of plain, relatable words.

                You haven't tested your draft with someone outside the team.

            <li>
                Everyone agrees with the draft—but no one feels moved by it.

## How long it takes

1-3 weeks.

In theory, identifying the critical insight could happen in as quickly as 2 to 4 hours, depending on how many interviews you've conducted and how much time your team has already spent reviewing the findings. Check out the [Conducting Discovery: Qualitative Interviews](/cel-playbook/03-marketing-discovery-qualitative-interview/) section of the Playbook if you need more information on best practices around audience interviews.

The reality is it can take a bit of time to uncover the right insights and craft the most impactful way to talk about it. This work is important, so don't rush it if you don't have to. Give yourself the space to do the work, share it with others to confirm it resonates, and then iterate where appropriate.

## Do it in a day

Get the team together for a morning or afternoon and tackle the challenge together. You can do this on your own, but it can be more effective to "workshop" this part with others, especially if they were involved in the audience interviews:

### Step 1: Identify your critical insight

- Review your interview notes or summaries as a group. Highlight meaningful quotes and patterns.
- Use the Audience Insight Canvas to explore what those quotes might reveal about needs, beliefs, or motivations.
- Look across the canvas for themes. What feels like the most important aspiration, need, or truth?
- Identify a respondent quote, or write one sentence that captures your critical insight.

### Step 2: Develop your "what's in it for me" statement

- Use the [Value Proposition Generator](/assets/cel/toolkit/value-proposition-generator.pdf){:target="\_blank"} to draft a short statement that reflects what your audience will get out of your program, and why it will matter to them.
- Focus on what people want to achieve or become, not just what your program does.
- Share your draft with someone outside the project team. Ask: does it feel human, clear, and relevant? Would a resident see themselves in it? Ask a partner, a stakeholder, or even someone represented by your target audience. Remember, you aren't conducting a new round of research, you are simply validating your language makes it easy to understand the idea you are trying to communicate.

## Outputs

- A critical insight documented in the [Audience Insight Canvas](/assets/cel/toolkit/audience-insight-canvas-r4.pdf){:target="\_blank"} that reflects the progress your audience is trying to make.
- A [value proposition statement](/assets/cel/toolkit/value-proposition-generator.pdf){:target="\_blank"}) that clearly communicates "what's in it for me" to your audience.
- A shared foundation to guide messaging, strategy, and creative development.

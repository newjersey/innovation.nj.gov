"Language access in the United States starts with plain English" — I often share this with colleagues, emphasizing that the first step in translation is turning complex jargon into clear, actionable, and empathetic English. As a woman who speaks English as a second language, this approach now comes naturally to me after realizing that my multilingual background is a strength, not a weakness.

My journey with language began early: as a kid, I was a Spanish-Portuguese interpreter for my grandparents and an English-Spanish translator as I navigated my own naturalization process from Argentina. Then, in my early career in the film industry, providing subtitles in other languages was much more than just a technical task: how do you write accessible yet poetic translations that describe the ethereal sounds of the Himalayas as the sun rises? How do you capture that essence in American English, Peruvian Spanish, or Haitian Creole?

I now have a profound appreciation for meaningful communication in across languages, a value shared by the Office of Innovation and with colleagues throughout the New Jersey government.

## Our First Case Study: Unemployment Insurance

Our commitment to human-centered language access truly came to life with our first major bilingual project: the 2023 Unemployment Insurance (UI) intake form. We launched this benefit in Spanish for the very first time, working with the New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development.

How did we get there? 

First, we recognized that UI systems are notoriously complex, often filled with legal jargon that even native English speakers find challenging. For claimants whose primary language isn't English, this hurdle grows further without thoughtful translation. The critical need to improve the quality of Spanish translations became clear when we examined the landscape, which applies to many government services:

* Complex government language: Auto-translations of public-facing services often mirror the complexity of the original English (which has failed to reflect plain language principles from the outset).  
* Diverse Spanish speakers: New Jersey is home to about 1.5 million Spanish speakers, representing a rich tapestry of dialects with distinct vocabularies. Some Spanish translations may fail to reflect the State —and the country’s—diversity, which can lead to exclusion and confusion.  
* Translation inaccuracies: Errors are too common due to a lack of native-speaker review or an over-reliance on unchecked machine translation.  
* Real-world consequences: Unclear wording can lead to claimants providing incomplete or incorrect information. This can result in delayed benefits, unnecessary denials, or even repayment directives for benefits they are rightfully entitled to.  
* Eroding trust: Ultimately, poor translations diminish user satisfaction and erode trust in public services, exacerbating disparities in access to vital support.

These general challenges were especially important to address with regards to UI, a crucial state benefit for many New Jerseyans. In fact, some Spanish speakers have paid third parties just to help them file a claim due to some combination of the above challenges, when they should be able to access these benefits for free and independently.

## Our Human-Centered Approach

During 2023, we tackled this problem. First, we focused on uplifting and learning directly from Spanish-speaking communities. We brought together a diverse group of native Spanish speakers and bilingual writers, specifically to co-create translations for a new UI claimant intake form. The invaluable insights gathered from this research, combined with the deep expertise of the NJ Department of Labor’s's bilingual call center team, directly shaped our framework.

Our goal was simple yet profound: to improve UI communications and better serve our Spanish-speaking residents. In pursuing this, we grappled with fundamental questions: What truly happens when plain English is translated into another language? How do we maintain the most inclusive approach across diverse cultures and vocabularies? How do we maintain accuracy in these efforts? And how do we ensure that equity is not just a concept, but a lived experience?

By valuing all of these complexities and nuances: 

* We worked through translations not as word-for-word conversions, but as powerful opportunities to validate and enrich claimants’ lived experiences.   
* We incorporated synonyms to address various dialects.    
* We wrote in gender-inclusive Spanish.    
* We championed transcreation, meaning we worked to determine style, tone, and original intent of the plain English.  

All of these efforts aimed to increase access, build trust, and create equitable experiences between English and Spanish speakers. 

The strategies learned during the UI modernization project — that we condensed in the [Spanish Translation Guide for Unemployment Insurance](https://usdr.gitbook.io/unemployment-insurance-modernization/language-access/spanish-translation-guide-for-unemployment-insurance) with our partners — gave us the framework to effectively translate "the plain" into "lo simple." During 2024, and with those guidelines in mind, the Office of Innovation was able to take plain English and manually translate into Spanish:

* **Information on how to file tax returns for free through Direct File.**  
* **Frequently asked questions and other information on Temporary Disability and Family Leave Benefits**.  
* **A glossary to help with understanding Family Leave benefits.**  
* **Information about tenants' rights during eviction situations.**

## Harnessing AI for Translation

With the knowledge we gained from this work, we fed our in-house Generative AI tool (the NJ AI Assistant) with bilingual style guides and glossaries — as my colleague [Ruthie Nachmany mentioned in a previous blog](https://innovation.nj.gov/blog/2025-07-17-aiassistantanniversary/).

Scaling manual translation efforts to more and more services and languages, or using tools that don't integrate with our development processes, is impossible. So far, we've prioritized Spanish because it's the second most spoken language in New Jersey; however, our goal is to offer these services in the most common languages for New Jerseyans with limited English proficiency: Spanish (Latin American), Portuguese (Brazilian), Korean, Gujarati, Chinese (Mandarin & Cantonese), Creole (French & Haitian), and Arabic. 

To use a cooking analogy, we might understand the ingredients and recipes—our vocabularies and competencies—but that alone won't deliver a great meal efficiently. We also need tools like ovens and blenders to speed up and amplify our efforts. With the sheer volume of content we need to process for broad language access, a comprehensive Translation Management System (TMS) becomes our essential kitchen. It enables us to nimbly prepare, monitor, and adjust while also ensuring quality and scale.

A Translation Management System (TMS) is a software platform designed to centralize, streamline, and automate various aspects of the translation and localization process. Think of it as a hub that connects content, people (translators, reviewers, project managers), and translation technologies, enhancing the efficiency of multilingual content production.

Thoughtful approaches to procurement in this area are crucial—yes, navigating procurement could be more challenging than translating the sounds of a Himalayan sunrise\! Following months of comparison and software testing, our TMS team's extensive research identified the considerations and evaluation criteria needed to select the optimal solution for our organization.

As a direct result of this effort, this year we shared our machine translation best practices and evaluation criteria that we are socializing with other state agencies. For starters, we successfully translated the [Job Protection Coverage Checker](https://innovation.nj.gov/projects/job-protect-checker/), marking it as the first public service platform we translated using a TMS, leveraging GitHub and Figma integrations to accelerate the process.

**5 Takeaways for Using Machine Translation in Content Design**

1) **Start, continue, and finish with a human in the loop:** Supervise, edit, and transcreate, completing the text as needed to create culturally sensitive translations. 
   **How?** Continually working with the same professional translator will allow you to work in an agile way, avoiding the blockers and inconsistencies that working with different vendors can create.

2) **Define your style and train teams and tools:** Voice and tone reflect the organization’s values, and are expressed in your communication. This will also achieve consistency, strengthening your content, and will be amplified in the translation process.  
   **How?** Create style guides and glossaries—starting with English and then in the targeted languages—test them, and use them to train your teams, partners, AI tools, and audience.  
     
3) **Use more than one AI tool:** Emerging technologies are unpredictable and can hallucinate. Use different tools, compare and validate.  
   **How?** Start with your preferred AI tool. The clearer the prompts, the better the results the tool will give. Step-by-step instructions and providing examples will enhance your results\!

4) **Prepare for the translation domino effect:** Translating just one page is rarely enough. What's your holistic approach?    
   **How?** It requires writers, designers, engineers, and subject matter experts to collaborate, identifying both an immediate, simple workflow and a desired, scalable one for the future.

5) **Plan a handoff and validation process:** How are we going to deliver, receive, and implement the translations? Who will review it?   
   **How?** Identify bilingual professionals to review and agree on a maintenance plan. When you do this, ensure these professionals are recognized for their bilingual work—for example, in their role's title and the bandwidth they need—and are fluent in the required language(s).

## Advancing Language Access Across State Government

This growing body of work aligns with a new State law \[P.L.2023, c.263\] that supports language access and resonates with me deeply. The law mandates the translation of vital State agency documents and information into the top languages spoken by New Jersey residents with limited English proficiency. 

## Clearly, we have the momentum right now to advance the idea that true, effective translation means conveying the essential spirit and meaning of the original text, ensuring that even when software is used as an aid, documents are thoughtfully translated. This human-centered approach is vital for us at the Office of Innovation, as we continue to explore more frameworks and scale accessibility with AI and machine translation.

## The Path Forward: Scaling Language Access

This journey is sometimes daunting, often exhilarating, and consistently challenging yet deeply satisfying. Currently, our focus is on expanding translations to the new products we develop and advising state agencies on translation and machine learning best practices. If you want to learn more about our progress and connect with us, you can register for free for our [upcoming InnovateUS webinar](https://innovate-us.org/beyond-translation-human-centered-language-access-with-ai) on this topic.

Multilingual content design is an evolving discipline, and Spanish is merely a starting point. Significant research and co-creation are essential to grasp the multicultural nuances required for engaging translations in each language. Continuously enriching our translation memory and the NJ AI Assistant with these learnings is a substantial yet impactful endeavor that helps us honor and better serve the diverse languages and cultures of the people of New Jersey. 

Thank you, 谢谢, Gracias, Dhanyavaad, 감사합니다, Obrigado\!


The result is that we’re now a model for how states can harness AI in a responsible and cost-effective way.

That’s good news for taxpayers, for government, and for the millions of people that state agencies serve throughout the Garden State.

Government programs are intended to help people, offering vital support, services, and opportunities designed to improve lives and strengthen communities. But too often, they struggle to reach the very people they were created for.

Government agencies have deep insight into the needs, goals, and lived experiences of the people they serve. But even with that understanding, it's easy to fall into a familiar pattern: as public sector professionals, we tend to communicate what we _think_ people need to know, rather than focusing on what _will_ actually motivate them to act.

The gap is not one of knowledge. It is a gap in framing. That’s where the **People Centered Marketing Toolkit** comes in.

This simple set of practical tools is designed to help people in public service turn audience understanding into messaging that truly resonates. It supports the development of creative assets that speak directly to what matters most to your audience. In doing so, it helps connect people with the programs, services, and benefits created to support them.

Whether you are launching a public awareness campaign, promoting access to a new benefit, or encouraging participation in a workforce or education initiative, this toolkit can help you work smarter, communicate more clearly, and ultimately make a greater impact.

**What’s in the Toolkit**

The People Centered Marketing Toolkit includes four core tools:

1. [**Audience Insight Canvas**](https://innovation.nj.gov/assets/cel/toolkit/audience-insight-canvas_r4.pdf)
2. [**Value Proposition Generator**](https://innovation.nj.gov/assets/cel/toolkit/value-proposition-generator.pdf)
3. [**Marketing Assets Standards Guide**](https://innovation.nj.gov/assets/cel/toolkit/Marketing-Assets-Standards-Guide.pdf)
4. [**UTM Generator for Campaign Tracking**](https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https%3A%2F%2Finnovation.nj.gov%2Fassets%2Fcel%2Ftoolkit%2Futm-builder-and-manager-playbook.xlsx&wdOrigin=BROWSELINK)

Each tool is simple, actionable, and designed to help you focus your time and effort where it matters most.

## \#1 Audience Insight Canvas: Build on What You Know

The **Audience Insight Canvas** is a framework that helps you turn what you’ve learned about your audience (from data, research and user interviews) into clear and usable direction for message development. It prompts you to go beyond demographic details or surface-level needs and capture the motivations, aspirations, concerns, and barriers that influence your audience’s behavior.

This tool helps sharpen focus. It translates insight into action by aligning you around a shared view of what will truly move your audience. Not just what they need, but what they care about.

Whether used in a brainstorming session or as a foundation for campaign strategy, the canvas brings clarity and cohesion to your planning process.

## \#2 Value Proposition Statement Template: Lead with What Matters

Government messaging often starts with how a program works, who is eligible, or what steps are required to participate. That information is important, but it’s not always what captures attention.

The **Value Proposition Statement Template** helps reframe your message so it begins with the benefit to your audience. It guides you to identify the answer to their first and most important question: _What’s in it for me?_

By focusing on relevance, this tool helps you craft headlines, taglines, and calls to action that feel personal and motivating. This approach makes your communications more effective without adding complexity.

## \#3 Marketing Assets Standards Guide: Make Every Asset Count

Inconsistency in tone, visual style, or content structure can erode trust and reduce the effectiveness of your campaign. The **Marketing Assets Standards Guide** offers a clear and flexible set of guidelines to help ensure that every creative asset you produce is aligned, accessible, and impactful.

It includes best practices for messaging tone, plain language, visual design, accessibility, and inclusive content. This tool is not about enforcing rigid templates. It is about equipping everyone in public service with what they need to create high-quality materials that reflect your values and connect with the people you serve.

Created by the New Jersey Office of Innovation’s Communication \+ Engagement Lab to use internally, the Guide is now being made open source. It’s not meant to replace any internal web standards or brand guidelines, but as an additional tool to help ensure all marketing assets adhere to the standards you set.

When we use the same foundation, campaigns feel coherent and credible, even when developed by different groups or delivered across multiple channels.

## \#4 UTM Generator: Track Performance with Confidence

Measurement is a key part of people centered marketing. Without it, you are left guessing about what worked, what didn’t, and why.

One way to do this is to use unique tracking links for all your campaign assets. The **UTM Generato**r makes it easy, creating tracking links for digital assets including email, social media, QR codes, and banners. UTM (Urchin Tracking Module) links are standard URLs with added parameters that provide extra data to web analytics tools like Google Analytics, allowing you to track the performance of your marketing campaigns more effectively.

With properly tagged URLs, you can monitor traffic sources, understand performance, and make informed decisions about where to focus your resources.This will give you the ability to learn from every campaign and tell a clear story about your impact.

### Why It Matters

People centered marketing is about more than getting the word out. It is about empathy, clarity, and relevance. It is about recognizing that even the most essential programs cannot make a difference if people do not know about them, trust them, or see how they fit into their lives.

We encourage you to use and/or share the **People Centered Marketing Toolkit**, adapt it, and share it with others. Because when we communicate with our audience about the things that matter to them most, we don’t just raise awareness, we build trust, encourage participation, and improve lives.

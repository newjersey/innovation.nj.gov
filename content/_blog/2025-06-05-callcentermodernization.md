When people think about innovation in government, they often picture sleek websites or new mobile apps. But for millions of residents, the most important service isn‚Äôt digital ‚Äî it‚Äôs a phone call.

Too often, that call can be frustrating, with long menus, confusing options, misrouting to someone who doesn‚Äôt have the answer, long hold times, and other barriers. 

We‚Äôre working to change that.

In New Jersey, our Office of Innovation is helping reimagine the phone systems that support public services. Over the last two years, we‚Äôve partnered with agencies to modernize 12 state call centers.

The results are clear: when menus are simpler, language is clearer, and self-service options are thoughtfully built in‚Ä¶ the caller experience ‚Äì and the overall system performance ‚Äì improves.

### **Why Menu Design Matters**

For many residents, calling a government office isn‚Äôt just about their question ‚Äî it‚Äôs about **access to crucial services**. To food assistance. To unemployment benefits. To tax support. To a new business license.

But we heard from callers about how the system itself had been a barrier. Some callers press ‚Äú0‚Äù out of confusion. Others try random options until someone can transfer them. Many give up entirely. 

These small moments add up. They strain agents, drive up wait times, and erode public trust.

That‚Äôs why we took a human-centered and data-driven approach to redesigning call menus. 

Our goal isn‚Äôt just to make the system more efficient. It‚Äôs to actually help more callers and to give them a good experience, while also helping agents feel more empowered to do a great job. 

### **Best Practices for Simpler, Smarter Menus**

We worked with agency teams, call center managers, and frontline agents to identify what works. Here are a few lessons we‚Äôve put into practice:

* **Keep menus short:** Callers can realistically remember 3 to 5 options. More than that, and they tune out or get confused.

* **Use plain language:** Avoid government jargon. Speak the way real people talk when asking for help. (If callers don‚Äôt hear a plain-language option, they‚Äôll often select random options, get routed to the wrong agent, or miss self-service options that save them time.)

* **Reduce sub-menus:** Every added layer increases complexity and the chance for drop-off.

* **Design for how people think:** Analyze caller data such as transcripts ‚Äî not government org charts ‚Äî when grouping options on menus.

* **Offer self-service where it makes sense:** If a question is frequently asked and always has the same answer, make that answer automatically available in the system. You can even text a link to a webpage or short video.

* **Include the ‚Äúother‚Äù option:** ‚ÄúFor all other issues, press 6,‚Äù is something we use and study. This option keeps users from being blocked and is an important diagnostic tool. If a high percentage of callers are selecting ‚ÄúOther‚Äù then you might be missing a critical option, or using language callers don‚Äôt understand.

* **Always find a path forward:** Give users an option to select if they still need help, and don‚Äôt force them to go back.

These changes do more than reduce frustration. They drive measurable results. 

In some of our modernized centers, we‚Äôve seen:

* **Wait times drop,** especially when more callers have the opportunity to self-serve

* **Up to a 15% increase** in total callers served, because more efficient routing leads to higher resolution rates 

* **Significant growth in calls resolved**, often without needing an agent

### **Where GenAI Can Help**

Improving call menus takes time‚Äîbut GenAI can help teams move faster by acting as a **thought or drafting partner**.

We‚Äôve developed a genAI Prompt Toolkit that helps agency staff draft and revise call menus using AI. We are exploring genAI to support with:

* Drafting an initial Interactive Voice Response (IVR) menu based on program information

* Rewriting confusing menu options in plain language

* Identifying opportunities for caller self-service options by analyzing FAQs and redacted caller transcripts

* Improving agent scripts so they are in plain language

* Supporting with translation

* Helping surface relevant information to agents

* Adding or refining a call option with minimal effort

It‚Äôs not about handing over system design to AI ‚Äî it‚Äôs about giving teams a head start. AI-generated drafts should always be reviewed, refined, and tested by real humans who understand the mission and values behind the work. No matter what you use generative AI for, remember it‚Äôs not an expert ‚Äì you are. Ensure that you review what it produces and protect private information.

### **Looking Ahead**

We‚Äôre continuing to refine our tools and strategies, and we‚Äôre committed to sharing what we learn. Call centers are often the **front door** to government ‚Äî and one of the few places residents can get real-time help. That makes them a critical part of building trust and delivering effective public service.

We hope these resources help other teams take the first step toward more human-centered ‚Äî and more efficient ‚Äî call centers.

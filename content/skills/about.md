Since 2019, the New Jersey State Office of Innovation has been offering at-your-own pace innovation skills training for Garden State public sector professionals through the NJ Innovation Skills Accelerator program. This work has featured a multi-module course in technology, data, and public engagement to improve how we deliver services to residents, as well as live workshops and custom courses developed for state agencies.

Current training opportunities are produced in partnership with InnovateUS - a multi-state coalition governed by public sector learning and innovation leaders from New Jersey, California, Colorado, Maine, and Pennsylvania. InnovateUS provides no-cost, at-your-own pace and live learning on data, digital and innovation skills for public sector professionals, providing the training and upskilling needed to deliver more effective, equitable and engaging policies and services.

New Jersey State government agencies interested in learning more about the Innovation Skills Accelerator program or exploring the development of custom courses for State agencies should email [team@innovation.nj.gov](mailto:team@innovation.nj.gov).

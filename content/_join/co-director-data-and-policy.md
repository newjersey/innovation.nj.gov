The New Jersey Office of Innovation is seeking a skilled and experienced professional to help lead our Data and Policy Team to leverage data and evidence to positively impact residents’ lives. The Data and Policy Team was created to strengthen the capacity of the New Jersey Office of Innovation and the broader State government to use data, evidence, and performance evaluation to measure and improve digital services, policies, and programs. We are currently developing tools to help teams use data to improve the impact of digital products and services on under-resourced communities, analyzing data on the use of government websites to enhance service delivery, conducting policy research on emerging topics such as AI regulation, and designing and implementing A/B tests to improve the performance of online tools and public engagement.

As Co-Director, you will play a central role in developing and advancing the team’s strategy, but you will also serve as an individual contributor - no task is too big or too small. You will develop internal team processes and project acquisition strategies, manage staff and projects, and drive the prioritization of team activities. You will also directly lead on projects related to performance measurement, data analysis, data visualization, impact evaluation, and evidence-based policy research. You will work closely with other directors to understand the data and policy needs of projects within the Office of Innovation, such as improving digital delivery of benefits and services to residents, making it easier to start, operate and grow businesses, and providing timely and clear information about government programs.

This role will report directly to the Office of Innovation’s Chief of Staff.

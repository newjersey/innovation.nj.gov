The New Jersey Office of Innovation is seeking a skilled and experienced professional to join our Data and Policy Team to leverage data and evidence to positively impact residents’ lives. The Data and Policy Team was created to strengthen the capacity of the New Jersey Office of Innovation and the broader State government to use data, evidence, and performance evaluation to measure and improve digital services, policies, and programs. 

In this role, you’ll join a new team dedicated to offering data services and activities, including performance measurement, data analysis, data visualization, impact evaluation, and evidence-based policy research. Building upon past successes in the Office of Innovation, this team is looking to more effectively, systematically, and sustainably incorporate data, evidence, and evaluation into Office of Innovation and New Jersey government projects to solve public challenges. We are currently developing tools to help teams use data to improve the impact of digital products and services on under-resourced communities, analyzing data on the use of government websites to enhance service delivery, conducting policy research on emerging topics such as AI regulation, and designing and implementing A/B tests to improve the performance of online tools and public engagement.

Ideal candidates may specialize in data analytics and data science, evidence-based policy research, or a combination of both.

The role will report to a director of the Office of Innovation’s Data and Policy Team.

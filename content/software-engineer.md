# Full-Stack Software Engineer

Location: flexible

# Our Team
The State of New Jersey Office of Innovation is looking for diverse and experienced team members to deploy world-class innovative and digital services that solve pressing public interest challenges for the people of New Jersey. We use data-driven, agile, and human-centered and equitable design practices to deliver innovative solutions involving tech, talent, process, and policy with the support of Governor Murphy and his Administration, the Chief Innovation Officer Beth Simone Noveck, and other senior leadership.

Our team operates as a startup within government, and our team members wear many hats, contributing to both the execution of core projects and the evolution of the Office of Innovation. We kickstart new initiatives and assist teammates and partners when urgent challenges arise. We use data and modern research, design, and development methods to inform our decision making, and we collaborate with stakeholders within and outside of government to understand and solve challenges.

# Full-Stack Software Engineer

We are seeking full-stack software engineers with at least 5 years of experience using modern languages and practices who can translate a concept into solutions for users. You should be comfortable working in a startup environment where you think independently and operate with a high degree of autonomy. We’re looking for self-starters who are skilled at driving projects forward while communicating and collaborating closely with the team.

# As a part of the team, you will:

- Deliver solutions that meet the needs of diverse users across New Jersey
- Operate as a solution architect, taking problems that may be poorly specified and finding the best software solutions, including evaluating custom developed vs. SAAS options
- Own features end-to-end, from planning to structuring data models to designing and building front-end interfaces
- Apply leading industry development practices to solve complex problems through the use of human-centered design, open-source development and innovation, data-driven decision making, and agile development practices
- Lead a team of engineers and/or the engineering process
- Deliver projects with complex requirements, multiple stakeholders with disparate views, or high levels of bureaucracy
- Deliver public-facing products or features on public-facing products with a large number of users (i.e. 100,000+)
- Deliver tools or products with high uptime or availability requirements (i.e. SLAs of 99.9%+)
- Work closely with product managers, designers, experts, leadership, and diverse stakeholders to translate findings and designs into product
- Iteratively release new product that can be tested with users
- Coordinate development activities (including the establishment of development processes) and make technical decisions that reflect the ideal solution and practical realities
- Build and maintain the underlying technical architecture and processes -- including a cloud environment as well as continuous integration, automated testing, and source control processes -- that will enable the team’s success across initiatives
- Develop technical documentation that can support the completion of state requirements
- Provide counsel on technical matters in plain language to our team and stakeholders
- Solve challenges using a wide toolkit that includes writing code, building the technical capacity of the team and State, translating user needs into technical decisions, mapping out technical options and architecture, and coaching and presenting to colleagues
- Coordinate and work with in-house department and agency technical teams, including those who support legacy systems, to execute on development projects and ensure that they are setup to succeed
- Take part in office-wide initiatives and stand-ups to enable collaboration and support across projects

# Preferred Technical Experience, Skills and Abilities

Applicants will be assessed based on an ability to excel at one or more software engineering disciplines: front-end engineering, back-end engineering, infrastructure engineering.

We are seeking individuals with the following experience, skills, and abilities:

- Working at all levels of the stack
- Ability to engage with technologies such as: modern JavaScript (strong) in a “Jamstack” architecture, React, Next.js, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML), JavaScript libraries, linting, and best practices, Amazon Web Services (AWS), “NoSQL” document store persistence, and Git/GitHub version control.
- Building and applying reusable front-end design patterns to reduce future development overhead
- Incorporating global web design assets
- Translating static mockups and images into working prototypes
- Ensuring 508 accessibility compliance with the assistance of automated testing tools
- Writing well-designed, testable, efficient code
- Writing automated feature/functional tests for application flows
- Ensuring seamless integration among front- and backend systems
- Mitigating common security vulnerabilities (e.g., cross-site scripting)
- Executing full lifecycle software development
- Consuming application programming interfaces (APIs) to new and legacy internal and external systems, some of which may be undocumented
- Translating application requirements into APIs, libraries/utilities, data models, and database schemas
- Writing developer-friendly documentation (e.g., API documentation, deployment operations)
- Improving shared libraries/utilities and practices around authentication, logging, alerting, and monitoring
- Debugging and diagnosing issues in distributed systems
- Designing infrastructure for supporting continuous integration, continuous deployment, and monitoring
- Ensuring system uptime and performance
- Monitoring and notifying appropriate officials in the case of security and data breaches

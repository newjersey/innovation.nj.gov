**"Over the next five years, what do you see as being the bigger effect from generative AI on the workforce in New Jersey?"**

Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is poised to radically transform how New Jerseyans work, our workplaces, and the skills we need to succeed in our work.

GenAI tools, such as ChatGPT, have an enormous potential to make our jobs easier, our work more productive, and to create new jobs. At the same time, GenAI may also present challenges such as eroding job quality and, in some cases, eliminating jobs altogether.

To effectively address the opportunities and challenges posed by advances in AI, it is critical that the State understands its workers’ greatest hopes and concerns. The State has convened an Artificial Intelligence Task Force to explore the challenges and opportunities when it comes to using GenAI tools in our workplaces.

## Your Voice Matters. We Want to Hear From You!

## Why Participating Matters

To better prepare the State, its institutions, and its people for the future that GenAI will bring, we need to better understand what YOU think are the most important opportunities and challenges created by advances in generative AI.

Your participation will help create a list of the hopes and concerns that YOU think are most important. The Task Force will use these insights to inform its recommendations to the State Government.

_NOTE: These answer choices are not endorsed by the State of New Jersey, the Office of Innovation, or the AI Task Force. Rather, they reflect a range of opinions._

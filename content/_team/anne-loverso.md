Anne LoVerso serves New Jerseyans as a software engineer, engaging in technical development and building modern digital solutions. Using her expertise in agile development, she works to make government services more accessible, data-driven, and people-focused. Her current work with the Office of Innovation focuses on improving the experience of starting, operating, and growing a business in the state through the Office’s Business First Stop initiative.

Anne worked previously as a senior full-stack software engineer and consultant at Pivotal Labs / VMware, helping enterprise and Fortune 500 customers build products and adopt practices for rapid software delivery and rapid feedback cycles using Extreme Programming (XP) methodologies and test-driven development. She led teams of engineers delivering mission-critical software in healthcare and retail while mentoring client engineers to become XP evangelists in their own companies.

Anne’s expertise stems from her experience at the intersection of engineering, education, and design. As a graduate of Olin College of Engineering, her rigorous engineering studies featured a high emphasis on collaboration, human-centered design, ethical technology, and community-centered development. She co-created a mobile makerspace initiative for youth in rural Mississippi, and worked at Insper Learning Institution in São Paulo, Brazil to help found the university’s undergraduate engineering program. In her free time, she plays and runs tabletop RPGs and tries to convince people that they aren’t just nerdy games, but collaborative fictive storytelling. She often succeeds.

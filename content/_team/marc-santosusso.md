Marc is a product manager on the Resident Experience initiative team at the Office of Innovation. He focuses on creating accessible solutions that reduce friction for both New Jerseyans and the agency employees who serve them.

In his previous role at a nonprofit, Marc led a cross-functional team responsible for building and maintaining the software used by specialists to assess eligibility and prepare benefit applications for tens of thousands of individuals across 7 states. The next generation of the platform introduced generative AI and Robotic Process Automation (RPA) features which reduced monotonous tasks and allowed specialists to focus on delivering human-first, empathetic service to their clients. Marcâ€™s journey in technology started before high-speed internet in technical support and software testing. 

Marc enjoys live music, exploring suboptimal strategies in board games, and hopes to one day do a tre flip on a skateboard.

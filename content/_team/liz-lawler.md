Liz Lawler serves as a product designer at the Office of Innovation. Working on the Resident Experience team, she supports team efforts to design and research equitable and innovative digital tools that improve how the State delivers benefits and services to its residents.

Before joining the Office of Innovation, Liz worked in public service for a Philadelphia-based non-profit to design interface systems, products, and services that improve access to government benefits.

Liz's diverse background also includes experience working in the private sector supporting client design needs in fields such as higher education, healthcare, and retail food service.

Katie Fiore leads strategy for the Office of Innovation’s Communication & Engagement Lab, where she is working to modernize and advance the State’s ability to effectively market and promote key services, programs, and initiatives through the use of research- and data-driven best practices.

Prior to joining the Office of Innovation, Katie led the development of growth marketing strategies and programs for consumer and B2B brands, both nationally and globally. She began her career in brand awareness advertising working with major consumer goods clients, but quickly transitioned to online marketing. She has spent the bulk of her career working with growth-driven clients using paid media as an acquisition channel and has built out and led in-house strategy, creative, and data & insights revenue centers for agencies. She is an enthusiastic devotee of marketing automation, hypothesis-driven testing frameworks, and a user-centered approach that leverages design thinking.

Outside of work Katie serves on the Board of Directors for the New York Coalition Against Domestic Violence, connects and mentors women through Her Future Work, is an avid pilates practitioner and blogs about the Catskills, baking and entrepreneurship. She is also a proud recipient of a Drum Award for Best Attribution Solution for a custom marketing tech stack she designed, and has been published in Fast Company, Forbes, Entrepreneur and Huffington Post.

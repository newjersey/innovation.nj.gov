David Powell serves as a content lead at the Office of Innovation. In this role, he functions as a primary content developer and editor for the New Jersey COVID-19 Information Hub, Business.NJ.gov, and email publications that reach millions of state residents.

David’s early career in information technology informed his later career in communications and data-driven media, affording him an uncommon degree of interdisciplinary know-how that allows him to contribute to a wide range of projects. He has worked in numerous industries, including financial services, technology consulting, media, public relations, healthcare, and pharmaceuticals. He joined the public sector in 2017 with the New Jersey Department of Health and came to the Office of Innovation in 2022.

A Central Jersey native, David was born and raised in the New Brunswick area. He is a magna cum laude graduate of Villanova University, where he also earned his Master’s degree in history. On clear, moonless nights, he’ll usually be found outdoors, using a telescope and a camera to corral ancient photons from distant galaxies. He also enjoys playing with wood and power tools, occasionally producing useful objects or folk art.

Hannah Chatham (she/her) serves as a product designer for the Office of Innovation, currently diving deep into best ways to provide more access for working parents as they apply for public benefits. She works at the intersection of research and design; listening to needs and iterating with visual solutions.

Before joining the New Jersey Office of Innovation, Hannah worked as a consultant at Openbox, a design studio focused on equity and justice strategy, where she designed workshops and research studies for a new construction project. Prior to that, Hannah worked with City ID on a five year redesign of all existing wayfinding design standards at San Francisco International Airport. Throughout her interdisciplinary design career of equity strategy, wayfinding design, service design, and industrial design, she aims to always listen deeply to peopleâ€™s needs, think broadly in creative solution finding, and co-create with humans using the final product whenever possible.

Hannah earned her Master of Art in Industrial Design from the Academy of Art University in San Francisco and completed a Bachelors of Art in Graphic Design from the California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo. Hannah spends her spare time painting murals at local schools, riding her bike, dancing bachata, building furniture and off-the-grid homes, and drinking way too much coffee.

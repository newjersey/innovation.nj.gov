Eesha Parasnis is a marketing research lead on the Office of Innovation’s Communication + Engagement Lab team. She conducts qualitative and quantitative research studies to uncover what resonates with New Jersey residents based on their behaviors, motivations, and emotions.

Eesha’s interest in research was initially sparked at the University of Michigan, where she completed her B.S. in Biopsychology, Cognition, and Neuroscience. Since then, Eesha has developed a portfolio of research projects across disciplines in various industries, including consumer electronics, consumer packaged goods, educational technology, consumer privacy, and e-commerce. She’s worked with a range of organizations, from large corporations and early-stage startups to academic institutions and more. Eesha’s M.S. in Information Experience Design from Pratt Institute trained her to approach research from a human-centered perspective, which she now brings to her first stint in the public sector.

Eesha’s approach to research is grounded by the principles of intentionality, systematic inquiry, and empathy. She also draws from her unique experiences of growing up across Japan, Thailand, India, and Hong Kong as a third-culture kid, to analyze and make sense of the world around her through a multicultural perspective. Outside of work, Eesha enjoys singing her heart out as part of the Metropop Choir, eating her way through the tri-state area, winding down with puzzle games, and spending time with her feisty cat.

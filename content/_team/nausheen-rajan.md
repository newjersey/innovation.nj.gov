Nausheen Rajan works on data analytics and impact analysis with the Office of Innovation. Her work focuses on identifying and measuring key performance indicators through quantitative and qualitative analysis.

Prior to her graduate studies, Nausheen worked as a senior associate at an international development consulting firm, where she provided project management and business development support for USAID-funded projects. Previously, she engaged with issues at the intersection of foreign affairs and economic development through work with the United States Department of State, and also at leading think tanks in Washington, D.C. She has also worked on initiatives that have built the capacity of women to create, sustain, and scale their businesses in Pakistan.

In 2020, she co-founded Ismailis Rise Up, in order to increase organizing efforts around voter participation and civic engagement within the Ismaili Muslim community. Last summer, she was awarded the Harold W. Rosenthal Fellowship by the U.S. Department of Labor.

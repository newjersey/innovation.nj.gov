Case Walker is a software engineer with the Office of Innovation working on the Resident Experience Initiative. Heâ€™s currently focusing on projects related to Unemployment Insurance modernization and improvements to Temporary Disability Insurance and Family Leave Insurance.

Previously, Case spent more than five years in fraud detection where he worked on low latency, high throughput distributed systems. This work utilized classic rules-based scoring engines as well as machine learning models, requiring diligent system monitoring and maintenance, as well as careful coordination between internal teams and clients. Case also worked as a software engineer at a national voter-registration non-profit, both helping people register to vote, and providing voters with personalized reminders and polling location data.

A graduate of the University of California, Berkeley, Case studied electrical engineering and computer science. He is an avid Rubik's cube solver and an occasional dancer. Case's primary bosses are his two cats, whom he loves dearly.

Case Walker is a software engineer with the Office of Innovation working on the Resident Experience Initiative, currently focused on call center modernization. This includes helping call centers transition to better technology; unifying the stateâ€™s overall call center approach; creating "missing pieces" of call center functionality to support agents, residents, and call center managers; supporting data visualization and analytics; and generally allowing more residents to seamlessly get the help they need while also reducing overall call center costs.

Previously, Case spent five years working in fraud detection, where he deployed low latency, high throughput distributed systems at various financial institutions. This work utilized both classic rules-based scoring engines as well as machine learning models, requiring diligent system monitoring and maintenance, along with careful coordination between internal teams and customers. Case also worked as a software engineer at a national voter-registration nonprofit, helping people register to vote and providing voters with personalized reminders about when, where, and how to exercise this fundamental American right.

A graduate of the University of California, Berkeley, Case studied electrical engineering and computer science with a minor in modern dance. He is an avid Rubik's cube solver and dabbles in chainmail jewelry. Case's primary bosses are his two cats, whom he loves dearly.

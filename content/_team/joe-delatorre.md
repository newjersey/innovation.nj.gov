Joe DeLaTorre supports technology and policy implementation on an array of initiatives for the Office of Innovation. He leverages human-centered design skills to develop and implement UX/UI and content changes on Business.NJ.gov, and investigates the use of new technologies and innovations to improve the experience of starting, operating, and growing a business in the Garden State. Joe also conducts policy research and formulates policy recommendations related to workforce development and the future of work.

Prior to joining the Office of Innovation, Joe was a member of a Washington D.C.-based consulting firm where he supported causes, philanthropies, and Fortune 100 companies on issues ranging from the opioid epidemic to expanding California’s EITC. Joe is a veteran of the United States Air Force where he worked as a Tactical Aircraft Maintenance Technician, and briefly worked as a high rise land surveyor in Southern California during the housing crisis.

Joe received his Master’s in Public Affairs from Princeton University’s newly rebranded School of Public and International Affairs, and his Bachelor of Arts in Political Science from the University of California, Los Angeles. Joe likes spending his spare time maintaining his vintage cafe racer and building furniture, although his new favorite pastime is coaching his daughter, Evelyn, through baby bootcamp.

The New Jersey Office of Innovation is working to develop genAI how-to guides on everything from drafting content, building custom genAI tools, to creating call center menus. We will be publishing new guides regularly, so check back or join our [newsletter](https://innovation.nj.gov/signup/).

New Jersey state employees can use our custom and secure [AI Assistant](https://ai-assistant.nj.gov/) for any genAI work.

## Improving Call Center Menus with GenAI

Our first guide is designed to empower non-technical leaders with actionable, accessible steps to improve their customer experience and a toolkit of vetted best practices for guiding call center modernization efforts using Interactive Voice Response (IVR) software. With these resources, you will learn how genAI can simplify the process of drafting menus to refining self-service options and routing calls effectively.

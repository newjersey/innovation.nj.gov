On October 10, 2023, Governor Murphy issued [Executive Order 346](https://nj.gov/infobank/eo/056murphy/pdf/EO-346.pdf){:target="\_blank"}. This Executive Order committed to creating a public sector training program to help New Jersey State government’s public sector professionals use generative AI to improve the delivery of services to Garden State residents, businesses, and institutions.

### Access the Generative AI Training Program

The State’s Generative AI training program has officially launched:

- Government employees, contractors, and those with access to the State’s Learning Management System can access the course.

### Review the State’s Policy on Acceptable Use of Generative AI

All state government employees using Generative AI should review the State’s [current policy to guide responsible use of the technology](https://www.nj.gov/circulars/23-oit-007.pdf){:target="\_blank"}.

### Accessing the NJ AI Assistant

The NJ AI Assistant is an internal generative artificial intelligence chatbot for use by NJ State employees and authorized parties. Before using the NJ AI Assistant, State employees and authorized users should begin the AI Training course — the training will direct you how to access the tool.

### Key Principles Guiding the State’s Use of Generative AI

There are four key principles that guide the State’s use of Generative AI:

- **Empowerment.** The use of AI should support our workforce to deliver enhanced services and products efficiently, safely, and equitably to all residents. We rely on the judgment of our professionals to ensure we realize the benefits of these tools.
- **Inclusion and Respect.** The use and development of AI should uplift communities, connecting them effectively with resources to thrive, especially those historically marginalized. As public stewards, we will use tools respectfully to reflect values of equity and social justice.
- **Transparency and Accountability.** We acknowledge the limits of foresight. But transparency builds trust and enables collective learning. When AI is used, we must disclose that responsibly and share our workflow freely with other public servants and with the public.
- **Innovation and Risk Management.** We embrace responsible experimentation that maintains control and respects privacy and security while developing uses that drive efficiency, dialogue, and better service. We understand risks may not be fully apparent initially and commit to proactive risk assessment.

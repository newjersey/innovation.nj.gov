Practical tools to help public sector teams connect with (and activate!) the people they serve

Government programs are built to help people, but even the most vital services can miss the mark if we fail to communicate in ways that truly resonate. The People Centered Marketing Toolkit from the State of New Jersey Office of Innovation’s Communication + Engagement Lab is here to help.

This free set of simple, actionable tools helps you translate audience insight into messaging that is relevant, motivating, and clear so you can connect your programs with the people they’re designed to support.

You can use the tools individually or together as part of your campaign planning process. They are designed to help you sharpen your messaging, improve creative quality, and measure results more effectively.

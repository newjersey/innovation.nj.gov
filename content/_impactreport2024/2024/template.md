To help working families make sense of their benefits and navigate a complex system, the Office of Innovation built the Maternity Coverage Timeline Tool in partnership with the New Jersey State Department of Labor. The tool explains what benefits are available to expecting parents and helps calculate the length and timing of paid leave so they can better care for their newborns.

## Challenge

Most people who work in New Jersey qualify for paid leave benefits under Temporary Disability Insurance and Family Leave Insurance. However, to use these benefits, parents must navigate a complex application process, tracking multiple details and making calculations on their own, increasing the likelihood of making a mistake or delaying access to the benefit.

## Innovation In Action

Working closely with community partners and expecting parents to understand their needs, OOI saw an opportunity to use technology to simplify a confusing aspect of family leave and reduce stress. After asking parents a series of questions, the tool automatically provides start and end dates for leave based on their specific circumstances and preferences, giving parents clarity about the benefits they can access and when. Residents using this resource have the option to leave feedback to improve it, which our team analyzes to make updates, ensuring the tool is continuously improving. The feedback is anonymized and analyzed by a generative artificial intelligence model, which identifies common trends in even large volumes of feedback that point toward areas for improvement.

## Impact

As of August 2024, more than 115,000 New Jerseyans have used the Maternity Coverage Timeline Tool to understand their benefits, and more than 523,000 timelines have been created since the tool launched in May 2022.

> "I just had a client reach out to us this week that she used the [maternity timeline] tool and was so happy to see exactly when she can start. She hadn’t realized that she can start her claim up to 4 weeks before her estimated due date…You can then clearly see the difference between taking Family Leave bonding time at once or in parts, as that can be confusing as well."

            <strong> Project Highlight</strong>: Call Center Modernization
        </p>

The Office of Innovation is working with multiple State agencies to streamline and modernize call center operations. By transitioning legacy contact centers that require manual operations to cloud-based systems powered by artificial intelligence, residents can get help more quickly and spend less time on hold. These improvements also allow State agencies to serve more residents with lower costs and greater efficiency, saving taxpayer dollars.

## Challenge

New Jerseyans seeking help with critical benefits often turn to the State’s call centers when they need to speak with someone to resolve their issues, however, at times, they face frustratingly long wait times or must call back repeatedly. Meanwhile, the busiest call center representatives are managing hundreds of calls a day.

## Innovation In Action

Rather than a one-time modernization project, the Office of Innovation sought to develop an approach that can be replicated with greater speed and efficiency at additional partner agencies. So after successfully helping to improve its first call center, OOI scaled those proven lessons and tactics and applied them to additional call center modernization projects, saving valuable time and resources. This playbook continues to be refined and improved upon with each partnership, and in doing so, OOI is decreasing modernization implementation timelines and delivering greater impact at a more rapid pace.

## Impact

- As of August 2024, 11 call centers – including those serving the ANCHOR property tax program, Temporary Disability and Family Leave, and Unemployment Insurance – have been modernized enabling them to efficiently manage over 5.5 million calls in a little over a year.
- The new system is projected to save millions of dollars for the Department of Treasury and the Department of Labor due to increased operational efficiency like a 50% boost in call resolution rates through self-service options and cost reductions from automated callbacks versus extended hold times that were not possible with previous platforms.
- As of August 2024, OOI helped reduce phone wait times for the ANCHOR hotline from 40+ minutes to an average of just 90 seconds using a new automated callback system that reserves a caller’s place in line and gives them a call back when an agent is available.
- The new system allows agencies to handle higher call volumes by developing self-service tools in English and Spanish so callers can resolve their own queries, drastically reducing wait times and freeing agents to speak with more residents that require live support.
- Callers can now get important links and information through text messages, making it easier for residents to resolve issues even while waiting to speak with an agent.
- The new system also provides critical data and insights from calls, so call center managers can proactively create new menu options and tools based on frequently asked questions as they emerge.

- **Problems that matter to real people.** We focus on concrete problems that affect New Jerseyans with a focus on individuals who have historically not had access to services.
- **Innovate with – not for – New Jerseyans.** We work directly with the people of New Jersey to understand their needs and then create solutions together.
- **Iterate and collaborate.** We work with our partners as early as possible to design and release solutions iteratively, get feedback, measure results, learn fast, and deliver impact in a continuous cycle.
- **Simplicity and ease.** We prioritize plain language, easy to use interfaces, and seamless access to services, so New Jerseyans can get the help they need as efficiently and conveniently as possible.
- **Accessible for all.** We ensure that regardless of language, access to computers, economic status, ability, location, age, or digital literacy, New Jerseyans will be able to use government services.

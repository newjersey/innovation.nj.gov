            <strong> Project Highlight</strong>: Data + Policy

To better serve residents and improve State programs and services, the Office of Innovation’s Data + Policy Team works with State agencies to leverage key insights from data, evidence, research, and performance evaluation.

## Challenge

Data, evidence-based research, and performance evaluation serve as powerful tools for addressing complex public challenges, improving policy decision-making, and supporting project improvement strategies. However, teams and projects often lack the capacity and expertise to employ a data-driven approach to make strategic decisions that improve program and service outcomes.

## Innovation In Action

The Data + Policy Team employs a variety of tools, strategies, and services to help State partners better serve the public. These services include deploying data visualization and reporting tools, leveraging statistical data modeling and analysis, A/B testing and experimentation, designing surveys to optimize response rates and insights, conducting evidence-based policy reviews, and implementing innovative platforms to better engage with the public.

## Impact

- To inform how more than $100 million annually in funds earmarked for sustainability funding should be allocated, the Team engaged with the public using an innovative survey tool. By the end of the four-week voting period, 6,370 New Jerseyans engaged with the campaign, made selections 24,414 times and submitted 163 ideas.
- By supporting upgrades to a key data analytics platform, the Business Experience team was better able to understand how current and aspiring business owners are accessing content and services.
- Your Future of Work, a problem identification consultation, was launched in partnership with the New Jersey Future of Work Task Force. The project engaged over 4,000 workers to understand how a changing economy and technology were impacting their jobs, and the results informed the Task Force’s final report and recommendations to the Governor.

The Office of Innovation’s work is guided by a central goal: to meaningfully impact how State government delivers services to improve the lives of New Jerseyans. As we evaluate the outcomes of our work, we look to an array of impact metrics and data - both qualitative and quantitative - to guide our organizational growth, evolution, and decision-making. These include:

- **Enhancing and streamlining how people interact with government** – time savings, satisfaction of people using the service, number of people served, and more
- **Government efficiency** – case resolution rates, agency staff time saved, number of New Jerseyans served, and more
- **Cost-savings** – actual and projected decreases in taxpayer dollars spent by agencies to deliver services

In addition to the measurable improvements we make to government services, the Office of Innovation works to build the State’s capacity to solve problems by using modern practices in two key ways:

- **Bringing new expertise and talent into State government** – modern problem-solving requires unique expertise and experience in technology, design, data, advertising, content, and policy. We attract top-tier talent from the private sector, academia, non-profits, and beyond and bring these dedicated professionals into public service to work on behalf of New Jerseyans.
- **Training and skill building with State agencies** – we works alongside our agency partners – not on their behalf – so they can learn how to implement modern best practices in research, design, policy, technology, and more. Along with our customized training programs, we equip our partners with the knowledge, skills, and technical abilities so they can continue to deliver impact long after our involvement with a project has ended.

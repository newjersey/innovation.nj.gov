            <strong> Project Highlight</strong>: Communication + Engagement Lab

To ensure New Jerseyans in need are actually using the programs, resources, and services they are eligible for, the Communication and Engagement Lab (C+E Lab) is helping State agencies more effectively connect with New Jerseyans by using data, research, and modern consumer marketing techniques to not only increase awareness, but move residents to action.

## Challenge

Government programs and services often lack adequate resources to reach audiences at scale. A lack of government capacity to deploy new tools, social and behavioral research, and data-driven insights means eligible residents often do not know about the programs and services available to help them so they miss out on valuable assistance.

## Innovation In Action

The C+E Lab encourages residents to take action by using proven consumer marketing techniques and data. Rather than relying on assumptions, the C+E Lab conducts research and leverages data to understand consumer motivations and then uses those learnings to craft strategies that meet consumers where they are and ultimately move them to action. This strategic approach is guided by research and focused on impact.

## Impact

- The C+E Lab supported the successful launch and ongoing optimization of Business.NJ.gov’s first paid media campaign. The award-winning campaign is reaching audiences beyond the State’s existing channels and increasing the user base of Business.NJ.gov, especially with underserved communities. As of August 2024, total visitors to Business.NJ.gov are up 75% year over year, usage from members of underserved communities is up 172% year over year, and visits from Spanish-language users have increased 778% year over year.
- In 2023, the C+E Lab advised and supported the Office of the Secretary of Higher Education in developing a paid media campaign designed to connect residents to the State’s Some College, No Degree (SCND) initiative – an effort to identify, reach, and engage adult learners who stopped out of college and need support to re-enroll. The campaign garnered 91 million impressions, 5.8 million video views, and connected more than 63,000 people with information about valuable State resources.
- The C+E Lab worked with the Department of Labor to launch messaging in support of the new MyCareer.NJ.gov platform. The announcement messaging began running in March of 2024 and in the first few days alone drove over 16,000 new users to the site, which is more than half of all visitors in the entire previous month.
- The C+E Lab conducted research for the State Library that identified a perception challenge with residents who stopped visiting the library in-person. Once residents became aware of the services the Library provided, they expressed an intent to return. The State Library used the C+E Lab’s findings to develop a new campaign that is driving residents back into the library again.

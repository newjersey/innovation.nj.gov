## A Message From The Chief Innovation Officer

For years now, our political discourse has been increasingly filled with cynicism, mistrust, and misinformation, and so it has been easy to lose sight of the fact that our State government exists for a simple reason: to help us in our time of need. Each day, thousands of public sector professionals across the state work tirelessly to ensure that help is there when New Jerseyans are sick, struggling to pay rent or the grocery bills, trying to keep our businesses afloat, and more.

Through our State’s many programs and services, the lives of millions of New Jerseyans are made a little easier so they can get ahead. But as technology has reshaped our world, how we get information, and how we interact, government has not always kept pace. So in 2018, Governor Phil Murphy appointed our State’s first-ever Chief Innovation Officer with a mission to improve the lives of New Jerseyans by designing and deploying more effective services.

New Jersey owes an enormous debt of gratitude to my predecessor, Beth Simone Noveck, who transformed an idea into an office, attracting dozens of talented and dedicated professionals into public service. Since its creation, that Office of Innovation has worked with nearly every State agency to reimagine government as we know it to better serve New Jerseyans.

When Governor Murphy appointed me as the State’s second Chief Innovation Office, I was humbled to step into the role: this is an enormous responsibility because, at its core, our work has the power to strengthen New Jerseyans’ trust in their government.

Our job is not just to ensure residents can get help when they need it – that’s the bare minimum. Our mission is to ensure that government can not only deliver services, but deliver those services more effectively and more efficiently - better and faster.

Working with our partners across State government, the Office of Innovation exists to make sure that when you call a hotline seeking help, you can actually speak to someone quickly and have your questions answered; that you can easily find the information you need without spending hours making sense of complicated documents; or that you can apply for a benefit program without spending hours or even days on an application.

Every minute we save you, every dollar we save our agency partners, and every time you walk away satisfied and with what you need from government is a win for the Office of Innovation, because bit by bit, we are strengthening trust in government by proving that the State can deliver for its residents in times of need. That is how we are helping to build a stronger, fairer New Jersey.

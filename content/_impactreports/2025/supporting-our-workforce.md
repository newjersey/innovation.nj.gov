## Snapshot

We turned legal language for federal and state leave laws into a simple form that over 5,000 New Jerseyans have used to understand their job protection eligibility when they need to take leave. A Spanish-language version of the tool was also released.

## What They're Saying

    <div class="usa-alert__body">
        <p class="usa-alert__text">
            "I'm proud that New Jersey provides robust job protections for workers who take health-related time off, whether it is to care for themselves or a family member, this tool helps to make sure everyone understands their rights under the law"

            <br />

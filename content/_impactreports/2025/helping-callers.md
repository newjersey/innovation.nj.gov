## Snapshot

With four being added over the past year, we’ve now upgraded 13 state agency call centers which have seen a 6 to 15 percent jump in callers who connect with an agent. Caller queues for many centers have dropped from over 30 minutes to about two minutes in wait time. We’re cutting costs roughly in half for many centers, while handling about 10 million calls over the past year. We also started using AI to analyze call transcripts so that the caller menus reflect options people need, and we launched a pilot of live chat to provide quicker and more convenient help.

## What They're Saying

{% include blockquote.html quote="By modernizing our call centers, we've significantly enhanced our ability to assist New Jersey workers. In unemployment insurance, we were able to connect 15% more callers to agents during peak times. We reduced caller abandonment in temporary disability and family leave insurance from 34% to under 2%. These efforts demonstrate our steadfast commitment to continuing to improve how we serve New Jersey workers in need." citation="Robert Asaro-Angelo, Commissioner of Labor, New Jersey" imgSrc="/assets/images/2025-impact-robert-asaro-angelo.webp" imgAlt="Robert Asaro-Angelo" %}

## Snapshot

Our data scientists harnessed AI to identify 200,000 additional kids across various state databases who were eligible for $120 in grocery benefits through the Summer Electronic Benefit Transfer program. This represents about 14% of the total enrollees, who received over $20 million in help in 2024 and 2025\.

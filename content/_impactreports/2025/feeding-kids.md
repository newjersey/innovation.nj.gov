## Snapshot

Our data scientists harnessed AI to identify about 100,000 additional kids--in both 2024 and 2025--across various state databases who were eligible for $120 in grocery benefits through the Summer Electronic Benefit Transfer program. This represents about 14% of the total enrollees and over $24 million in help.

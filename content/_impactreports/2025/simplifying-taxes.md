## Snapshot

We designed a seamless, secure, and quick tool for 8,600 New Jerseyans to file their federal and state tax returns, saving them $1.4 million in estimated fees and disbursing $3.8 million in refunds. The state filing process only took about 10 minutes because the tool broke down New Jersey’s tax code to a few simple questions, it helped people automatically claim popular tax credits, and it enabled filers to immediately port their household and income information to their state return.

## What They're Saying

97% of DirectFile users said they were satisfied or very satisfied. 92% preferred this over previous filing methods. Survey respondents said:

"I’ve used tax software for over 20 years now. This was easy and didn’t cost me anything."

"It’s perfect. I couldn’t believe how easy it was. You saved me over $200 in fees."

"My favorite thing about this site is that I don’t have to fill in so much info because a large majority of it was filled in automatically from my federal return. It does all of the work."

"Thank you for this wonderful tool. It’s a very simple and easy-to-use tool for someone who doesn’t know much about these processes."

"It’s a wonderful free application to submit tax returns. I would recommend all to file through this."

## Snapshot

We designed a seamless, secure, and quick tool for 8,600 New Jerseyans to file their federal and state tax returns, saving them $1.4 million in estimated fees and disbursing $3.8 million in refunds. The state filing process only took about 10 minutes because the tool broke down New Jersey’s tax code to a few simple questions, it helped people automatically claim popular tax credits, and it enabled filers to immediately port their household and income information to their state return.

## What They're Saying

97% of DirectFile users said they were satisfied or very satisfied. 92% preferred this over previous filing methods. Survey respondents said:

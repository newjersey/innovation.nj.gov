## Snapshot

Through compelling, user-tested campaign messages, we motivated New Jerseyans to tap into state benefits designed to help them in key moments. This included:

- an insight-driven effort that drove 83% of the traffic to a new free-tax-filing site ([DirectFile.NJ.gov](http://DirectFile.NJ.gov))
- a wide-reaching campaign that activated residents to visit [CollegeForYou.NJ.gov](http://CollegeForYou.NJ.gov)[,](http://CollegeForYou.NJ.gov) apply for financial aid in record numbers, and enroll in colleges throughout New Jersey
- a campaign that has driven 1.5 million site visits (surging 1,400% in 2025) and 5,000 sign-ups to the state’s hub for job training and resources ([MyCareer.NJ.gov](http://MyCareer.NJ.gov))

**Our mission** is to improve the lives of New Jerseyans by solving public problems differently. In partnership with State departments and agencies, we help deliver better government products and services, ensuring they are as effective, efficient, and responsive as possible.

**We do this by** working alongside those agency partners while fostering knowledge, skills, and technical abilities that reflect best practices in research, design, technology, policy, and more. We use modern, data-driven, human-centered, and agile processes to clearly understand problems. And, we work directly with New Jerseyans along the way, iteratively creating better and better solutions while reducing barriers and friction at every turn.

**We have attracted world-class talent** to our team, which consists of dedicated professionals with diverse public and private sector backgrounds, including Fortune 50 companies, leading consulting firms, startups, civil society organizations, federal agencies, the White House, community-based organizations, and more. These dynamic individuals bring deep expertise in technology, design, and data, as well as government, policy, public engagement, and more. We all wear many hats as a team of doers - no task is too small and no problem is too big.

**We are passionate about transforming the way the government operates and improving the lives of all New Jerseyans.** We will continue to design and deploy world-class, innovative, and inclusive services and policies that solve pressing challenges.

**The Office of Innovation’s work is organized around four core initiatives:**

### The Resident Experience Initiative

Streamlining, simplifying, and improving how New Jersey delivers benefits and services to residents.

### The Business Experience Initiative

Making it easier to start, operate, and grow a business in New Jersey.

### The Communication + Engagement Lab

Leveraging modern consumer marketing and communication approaches to better connect New Jersey’s residents and institutions to state programs, resources, and services.

### Data + Policy

Advancing the use of data, evidence-based research, and performance evaluation to solve complex public challenges in New Jersey State government.

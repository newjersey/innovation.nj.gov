Over the past year, the New Jersey Office of Innovation has partnered across government to deliver benefits to people when they need it most. We’re using the right technologies in the right ways at the right moments to help New Jerseyans get what they need.

That includes the family that needs a little more help to buy healthy groceries for their kids over the summer… the entrepreneur who has a great business idea but dreads having to comb through legal language and red tape… the community member who sees a need for more transit options but doesn’t have access to data… the caller who needs to talk to someone at an agency as quickly as possible… and more that you can see in this year’s report.
Making government work better for everyone is a commitment shared by the Office of Innovation and its agency partners. New Jersey has made smart, cost-effective investments in a talented innovation team that is laser focused on how we can all work together to truly improve people’s lives.

That’s why we have taken on major challenges over the years - from overhauling our unemployment insurance application system to piloting our State’s first-ever free income-tax filing tool.

It’s great to see the hard work of our team being recognized beyond the state. New Jersey was recognized as the top state (alongside just two others) for AI readiness from Code for America, one of the country’s most respected nonprofits in civic technology. That’s because we have helped create some of the leading AI policies and tools for government and our 9.5 million residents. We will continue to lead and serve as a national model for harnessing responsible AI for good in the months and years ahead.

We are indeed poised to do even more groundbreaking work, but - as always - we believe in building alongside our partners and the public to make government deliver better for everyone. As you look through this year’s report, maybe you have an idea for what that looks like - drop us a line at [team@innovation.nj.gov](mailto:team@innovation.nj.gov). We look forward to hearing from you.

Yours in service,

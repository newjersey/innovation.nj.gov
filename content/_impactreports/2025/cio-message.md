Over the past year, the New Jersey Office of Innovation has partnered across government to make a real difference in people's lives. We're focused on using technology thoughtfully and strategically to help New Jerseyans get the support they need, exactly when they need it.

That includes families getting help to buy healthy groceries for their kids over the summer through improved Summer EBT access, entrepreneurs navigating business permits and licenses without getting tied up in red tape, community members accessing transit data to advocate for better local services, callers reaching the right person at state agencies faster than ever, and more stories profiled in this report.

The progress shown in this and last year's report is made possible by sustained investment in building capacity. Governor Murphy and the New Jersey Legislature have committed to growing a talented innovation team that stays laser-focused on actually improving people's lives. We share this commitment with our agency partners, and it drives everything we do.

It's why we've tackled major challenges over the years — from responding to the COVID-19 pandemic and overhauling the unemployment insurance application to piloting the state's first free income-tax filing tool through Direct File.

New Jersey is leading the nation in service delivery, and our work is getting noticed beyond our borders. For example, nonprofit leader Code for America recently named New Jersey as one of the top states for AI readiness — recognition that reflects our commitment to leading AI policy and deploying responsible AI tools that serve all 9.5 million New Jerseyans. Over 15,000 state workers now use the NJ AI Assistant (a Generative AI tool) we developed, at a fraction of the cost of commercial alternatives. Similarly, our data-driven campaigns to raise awareness of public programs have received recognition from local and national organizations alike.

We appreciate the recognition as a national model, and we strive to share our work broadly, including by releasing tools (like the NJ AI Assistant) as open-source projects and writing freely-available playbooks, like how to run performance-driven marketing campaigns in the public sector.

As we look ahead, we’re focused on even more impactful work. But as always, we believe the best solutions come from building alongside our partners and the public. As you explore this year's report, maybe something sparks an idea for how we can do better together. If so, drop us a line at team@innovation.nj.gov. We genuinely want to hear from you.

Yours in service,

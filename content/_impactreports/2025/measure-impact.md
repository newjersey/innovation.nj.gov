The Office of Innovation’s work is guided by a central goal: to meaningfully impact how State government delivers services to improve the lives of New Jerseyans. As we evaluate the outcomes of our work, we look to an array of impact metrics and data - both qualitative and quantitative - to guide our organizational growth, evolution, and decision-making. These include:

- **Enhancing and streamlining how people interact with government** – time savings, satisfaction of people using the service, number of people served, and more
- **Government efficiency** – case resolution rates, agency staff time saved, number of New Jerseyans served, and more
- **Cost-savings** – actual and projected decreases in taxpayer dollars spent by agencies to deliver services

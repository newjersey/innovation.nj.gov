## Snapshot

We built a secure Generative AI tool (NJ AI Assistant) within the New Jersey government that 15,000 public service professionals in New Jersey have used over half-a-million times to work more efficiently and effectively. The tool – expanded in April to include more and larger file types – has saved the state millions of dollars at a cost of just $1 per user per month. The tool is coupled with New Jersey’s leading AI usage policies and trainings that have been made available to and used by more than 25 states and localities.

In addition, the Office of Innovation piloted new AI tools that have great potential. For example, one tool provides immediate, automatic notification to users to make corrections when submitting files (which helps reduce “cure cycles” from 10-40 days to minutes). Another helps automatically populate information from PDFs and text files, essentially eliminating staff time for some repetitive tasks while maintaining 95% accuracy.

## Snapshot

We built a firewalled GenAI tool (NJ AI Assistant) within the New Jersey government that 15,000 public service professionals in New Jersey have used over half-a-million times to work more efficiently and effectively. The tool – expanded in April to include more and larger file types – has saved the state millions of dollars at a cost of just $1 per user per month. The tool is coupled with New Jersey’s leading AI usage policies and trainings that have been made available to and used by more than 25 states and localities.

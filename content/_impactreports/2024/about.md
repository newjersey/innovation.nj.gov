Our mission is to improve the lives of New Jerseyans by solving public problems differently.

In partnership with State departments and agencies, the Office of Innovation helps deliver better government products and services, ensuring they are as effective, efficient, and responsive as possible.

We do this by embedding with agencies across State government, working directly with residents, and using modern, data-driven, human-centered, and agile processes to better understand problems, and then iteratively solve those problems to help the New Jerseyans we serve. Our cross-functional teams use their expertise in everything from data to design, engineering to policy, product to communications, and more to develop innovative solutions to the most pressing challenges facing residents, businesses, and institutions across the Garden State.

The Office of Innovation’s work is organized around four core initiatives:

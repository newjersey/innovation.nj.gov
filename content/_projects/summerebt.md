title: Summer Electronic Benefits Transfer
initiative: Resident Experience Initiative
---

The Office of Innovation worked with the NJ Department of Agriculture (NJDA) to solve complex data challenges and issue $120 Summer Electronic Benefit Transfer (Summer-EBT) grocery benefits to thousands of eligible children in 2024 and 2025 that would not have received them otherwise.

### Challenge

Children can qualify for Summer EBT benefits through their school district (that participates in the National School Lunch Program / School Breakfast Program) if they have been certified as eligible to receive federal free or reduced price meals. They may also qualify if they are recipients of SNAP, TANF, income-eligible Medicaid, or Foster care programs (STMF). 

After issuing benefits to school meal recipients, NJDA faced challenges determining which STMF children had already received benefits and which ones still needed them, because these data sources are stored at different agencies without an easy way to verify if a child is in both datasets. NJDA came to OOI for support in deduplicating these multiple datasets to identify the eligible recipients of Summer-EBT benefits.

### Innovation In Action

In 2024, our data science team developed a process to identify unique eligible students, iteratively refining a machine learning model to deduplicate the data in close collaboration with NJDA. In 2025, we built on that successful foundation to identify duplicates and issue all benefits at the beginning of the program season (instead of in stages). We now are building a process to issue benefits on a weekly basis to newly-eligible children throughout the summer.

### Impact \+ Metrics

* About 106,000 children on STMF received benefits in 2024 because of our deduplication efforts, about 15% of total benefit recipients. That totals about $12.8 million in additional benefits issued to children identified as eligible by OOI.
* As of June 2025, about 76,000 children on STMF have been identified to receive benefits, about 11% of total benefit recipients. This totals about $9.1 million in additional benefits to be issued to children identified as eligible by OOI.

### Status

* The first benefits for Summer 2025 went out in June 2025. 
* OOI will support benefit issuance processes and decision-making tools to help NJDA make informed choices related to ongoing deduplication efforts.

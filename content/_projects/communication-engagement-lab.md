The Communication and Engagement Lab (C+E Lab) is an initiative that aims to modernize and enhance the State’s ability to better connect New Jersey’s residents and institutions to State programs, resources, and services through the use of data, research, and modern consumer marketing techniques.

### Challenge:
 Government programs and services often lack adequate resources to reach audiences at scale. A lack of government capacity to deploy new tools, social and behavioral research, and data-driven insights means eligible residents often do not know about the programs and services intended to serve them.

### Innovation In Action:
 The C+E Lab moves residents to take action by using proven consumer marketing techniques and data. Rather than relying on assumptions, the C+E Lab conducts research and leverages data to understand consumer motivations and then uses those learnings to craft strategies that meets consumers where they are and ultimately move them to action. This strategic approach differs from traditional government communications efforts as it is guided by research and focused on impact.

### Impact + Metrics

- The C+E Lab supported the successful launch and ongoing optimization of Business.NJ.gov’s first paid media campaign. The campaign is increasing the user base of Business.NJ.gov and is providing learning around channels, tactics, and creative execution. The campaign is also enabling us to create an understanding on if our efforts are equitable in their reach.
- The C+E Lab advised and supported OSHE to develop a paid media campaign designed to connect residents to the State’s Some College, No Degree initiative. The campaign will launch in late August and create “leads”, residents that indicate they are interested in learning more about the SCND initiative, that a State procured vendor will work to enroll.
- The C+E Lab conducted research for State Library that identified a perception problem with residents who stopped visiting the Library in-person. Once residents became aware of the services the Library provides, it created intent to return. Library used our findings to develop a new campaign that is driving residents back into the Library again.

### Status

- The C+E Lab was launched in early 2022 and has conducted several engagements with State teams and agencies. In 2023, the Lab seeks to launch two high-impact marketing campaigns with its State partners.

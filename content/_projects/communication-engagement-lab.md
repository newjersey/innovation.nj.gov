The Communication and Engagement Lab (C+E Lab) aims to modernize and enhance the State’s ability to connect New Jersey’s residents and institutions to State programs, resources, and services through the use of data, research, and modern consumer marketing techniques.

### Challenge

Government programs and services often lack adequate resources to reach audiences at scale. A lack of government capacity to deploy new tools, social and behavioral research, and data-driven insights means eligible residents often do not know about the programs and services available to help them.

### Innovation In Action

The C+E Lab encourages residents to take action by using proven consumer marketing techniques and data. Rather than relying on assumptions, the C+E Lab conducts research and leverages data to understand consumer motivations and then uses those learnings to craft strategies that meet consumers where they are and ultimately move them to action. This strategic approach is guided by research and focused on impact.

### Impact \+ Metrics

* The C+E Lab supported the successful launch and ongoing optimization of Business.NJ.gov’s first paid media campaign. The campaign increased the user base of Business.NJ.gov, especially from underserved communities. As of the end of the campaign (February 2025), users were up 10% year over year (year to date), with traffic from members of underserved communities up \+23% year over year (year to date), and visits from Spanish-language users increased \+53% year over year (year to date).   
* In 2023, the C+E Lab advised and supported the Office of the Secretary of Higher Education in developing a paid media campaign designed to connect residents to the State’s Some College, No Degree (SCND) initiative. The campaign garnered 91 million impressions, 5.8 million video views, and connected more than 63,000 people with information about valuable State resources. The campaign also generated more than 2,000 leads with 86% of attributable leads from members of underserved communities.  So far, the overall initiative has re-enrolled 11,900 learners with 1,100+ graduating to date.  
* The C+E Lab is working with OSHE and HESAA on a marketing campaign to generate enrollments of aid-eligible residents in 2- and 4-year higher education institutions in New Jersey. The new campaign's key video asset has been viewed over 15 million  times as of August 2025, and the campaign has driven over 1 million clicks, with 4% of traffic moving on to access financial aid information (including accessing the FAFSA/Alt App). Over 67% of the eligible population has completed the application. The campaign runs through September 2025\.  
* The C+E Lab is working with the Department of Labor to increase usage of the MyCareer.NJ.gov platform. The campaign launched in October 2024 and has driven 1.5 million visits as of August 2025\. The new video ads have been shown over 40.5 million times as of August 2025 and the campaign has generated 1.2 million clicks. Since the launch of the video ad in April 2025, traffic to My Career NJ has increased \+1,400% year over year. In Q1 of 2025, traffic to the site from members of historically underserved communities increased \+578%.   
* In support of DOS’ Election Information efforts, the C+E Lab is advised on resident research led by USDR to understand the sources and mechanisms residents use to access election information.  
* In support of Summer EBT marketing, the C+E Lab developed creative assets to support an out of home campaign, as well as worked with State partners to arrange for the out of home media inventory to be provided at no cost. Creative assets for Summer-EBT were delivered to the NJ Office of Food Security Advocate to deploy in June 2024\.    
* The C+E Lab led a rebrand of DOL’s Lifelong Learning Account initiative. By conducting quantitative research to test different consumer-friendly names to identify the most effective and equitable option, the C+E Lab identified the most appealing name, Fund My Future, to be used in an upcoming marketing campaign. Additionally, C+E Lab developed copy for an informational microsite that works to simplify a complicated proposition for multiple audiences and aims to support the generation of 700 enrollments in the program. The C+E Lab partnered with DOL to develop a press release and creative assets that supported the relaunch of the program to residents throughout NJ.  
* The C+E Lab conducted research for the State Library that identified a perception challenge with residents who stopped visiting the library in-person. Once residents became aware of the services the Library provided, they expressed an intent to return. The State Library used the C+E Lab’s findings to develop a new campaign that is driving residents back into the library again.

### Status

* The C+E Lab was launched in early 2022 and continues to conduct major end-to-end campaigns with State teams and agencies, along with limited engagements primarily focused on research, validation, and establishing benchmarks for future learning.   
* As of August 2025, projects include working with the Office of the Secretary of Higher Education and the Higher Education Student Assistance Authority to develop a new marketing campaign to generate enrollments of aid eligible-residents in 2- and 4-year higher education institutions, working with the Department of Labor to develop an annual communication strategy to inform messaging outreach for the newly launched MyCareerNJ platform, working with the Business.NJ.gov team to extend the impact of its paid media campaign, and more.   
* In July 2025, the C+E Lab launched a new Marketing and Communication Community of Practice with 23 State employees who conduct resident outreach, communications, marketing, and other aspects of program development. This community is working to drive uptake of State programs and services through knowledge sharing, collective problem solving, and community building.

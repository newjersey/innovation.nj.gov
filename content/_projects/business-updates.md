Business.NJ.gov Updates is an email update program that proactively shares information on new programs, services, and regulatory changes for businesses and nonprofits operating in New Jersey.

### Challenge

The rapid creation of emergency aid programs, new safety requirements, and other critical developments during the pandemic underscored the need for additional ways to keep businesses in New Jersey up to date with the latest news. Traditional media outlets and social media offered limited reach when it came to news that specifically affected businesses, so many business owners missed out on important information and opportunities.

### Innovation

To provide the State with the means to more effectively and proactively reach businesses, OOI launched an email update program to inform businesses about regulations and news. The newsletter uses plain-language and focuses on actionable news and information. Through the continuous analysis of data analytics and periodic engagement with users, OOI improves communication and service delivery.

### Impact + Metrics

- In 2024, the number of subscribers more than doubled and now exceeds 270,000 as of August. 
- The Business.NJ.gov Updates program has generated millions of interactions with subscribers, significantly increasing awareness of an array of policy priorities and programs. The program has generated more than 260,000 engagements with updates on funding programs, regulatory guidance, and other information pertinent to the business community.


### Status

-   OOI continues to work with State departments and agencies to directly send updates to tens of thousands of businesses' inboxes.

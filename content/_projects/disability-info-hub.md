title: Disability Information Hub
initiative: Resident Experience Initiative
---

New Jersey’s [Disability Information Hub](https://www.nj.gov/disabilities/) offers a central source of information for individuals with disabilities as well as their families and caregivers. The site consolidates critical information from dozens of agencies in a user-friendly and accessible format on a range of topics from health care to utility assistance, transportation to in-home support, and more.

### Challenge

There are a multitude of State programs that support people with disabilities, however finding and accessing them can be a challenge as they are largely organized by the agency responsible for administering the program. As a result, residents often find themselves poring over dozens of different State websites to find information which increases the likelihood that they may not get the information or help they need.

### Innovation In Action

OOI collaborated with the NJ State Department of Human Services, the Office of the Governor, and program managers across State government to build the Disability Information Hub around specific user needs rather than organizing information by government agency. In addition, to ensure users’ needs are fully met, OOI first conducted a survey and worked with advocacy organizations to understand the most pressing needs and challenges of New Jerseyans with disabilities. The development and design process also incorporated input from individuals with lived experience, state agencies and offices, external partners, and accessibility experts. With feedback options on every page, the Hub welcomes additional user feedback to continually evolve the Hub to better serve the disability community.

### Impact \+ Metrics

* With the launch of the Disability Information Hub, New Jerseyans with disabilities and their families and caregivers no longer have to navigate a maze of state agencies and instead have an easy to use, centralized portal for all their needs.

title: Artificial Intelligence Task Force
initiative: Data + Policy
---

In October 2023, Governor Phil Murphy created the Artificial Intelligence Task Force to study the potential impacts of AI on society and to prepare recommendations for government actions encouraging the ethical use of AI technologies. The Task Force is co-chaired by New Jersey’s Chief AI Strategist, the Chief Technology Officer, and the CEO of the Economic Development Authority, who are joined by other leading Cabinet officials. The Task Force’s work is supported, in part, by the Office of Innovation.

### Challenge

AI presents enormous opportunities for breakthroughs in innovation, economic growth, education, and government service delivery that can significantly improve our lives. However this rapidly developing technology can also create new risks – especially when used irresponsibly. So it is critical for New Jersey to continue fostering an environment for innovation, while also protecting individual and civil rights and ensuring that the State’s use of AI is fair, accessible, and beneficial to all New Jerseyans. 

### Innovation In Action

Rather than standing by as AI develops, the Task Force presents an opportunity for New Jersey to play a role in the technology’s development. With support from the Office of Innovation, the Task Force aims to not only think deeply about how to encourage innovation and economic growth, and promote social and economic equity, but to also offer recommendations on government actions that encourage the ethical use of AI technologies. Recognizing that government does not have all the answers, the Task Force has tapped the collective intelligence of industry, academia, as well as consumer protection experts. Through several working groups, these experts will focus on: AI and Workforce Training, and Jobs of the Future; AI, Equity, and Literacy; Making New Jersey a Hub for AI Innovation; and Security, Safety, Technology, and Privacy Considerations for AI.

### Impact + Metrics

- To equip State employees with the knowledge and skills to responsibly leverage AI to solve real problems for New Jerseyans, the Office of Innovation, in collaboration with InnovateUS, released one of the nation’s first [comprehensive generative AI (GenAI) training programs](https://innovation.nj.gov/skills/ai/).
- To ensure State employees have the tools to safely and responsibly leverage AI to  improve government services and operations, the Office of Innovation, in partnership with the Office of Information Technology, launched the [NJ AI Assistant](https://innovation.nj.gov/projects/ai-assistant/), a powerful GenAI platform that provides a safe “sandbox” environment for State employees to begin using the technology.
- In a national first, New Jersey consulted workers in the state about generative AI. Given the technology’s potential to transform the nature of work and the skills needed to succeed, the State of New Jersey’s Artificial Intelligence Task Force sought to hear directly from workers about their hopes and concerns about the technology. The results will inform the Task Force’s recommendations to the Governor.
- New Jersey was also the first state to launch a comprehensive survey of public-sector employees’ knowledge, attitudes and interests around AI. Rather than a top-down process, the Task Force is building an ethical framework for AI in State government by engaging its employees

### Status

-   As of November 2024, The Task Force and its numerous working groups have delivered their recommendations to the Governor on how the State can encourage the ethical and responsible use of AI, improve government services, expand economic opportunities, and promote equitable outcomes.

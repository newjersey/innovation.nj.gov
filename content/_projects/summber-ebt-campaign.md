title: Summer EBT Enrollment Campaign
initiative: Communication + Engagement Lab
---

In partnership with multiple State agencies, the C+E Lab helped to support low-income families and keep children from going hungry in the summer months by increasing the number of eligible families enrolled in the Summer Electronic Benefit Transfer (S-EBT) program. The program provides food benefits to low-income families to buy groceries during the summer when kids do not have access to free school meals. 

### Challenge

Hundreds of thousands of children in New Jersey rely on free school meals to get the nutrition they need to grow and learn. To ensure children do not lose this critical lifeline and go hungry during the summer, the S-EBT program provides families with money to buy nutritious food during those months. However, as a new program in its first year, many families may not know they are eligible for this benefit and can apply through their child’s school. As a result, many children and families could miss out on this crucial benefit.

### Innovation In Action

To drive awareness for S-EBT and boost enrollment of eligible families, the C+E Lab used proven best practices from the marketing industry to simplify language on the S-EBT website, emails, flyers, and other outreach materials for schools, community-based organizations, and State agencies so residents could more easily understand the program and take action. 

### Impact \+ Metrics

* Families can now more easily enroll in the program thanks to a redesigned NJ Summer EBT website that features plain, easy to understand language and simpler navigation.   
* In 2024, over $70 million in benefits were issued to more than 600,000 eligible children to help buy food for their children in the first year of the program. In 2025, over $90 million was issued to more than 693,000 eligible children.

### Status

* The C+E Lab’s input was used in 2024 in support of the Summer EBT program.

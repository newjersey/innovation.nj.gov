title: Out of State Traveler Registration Form
initiative: COVID Response
---

The [Out of State Traveler Registration Form](https://covid19.nj.gov/forms/njtravel) was a voluntary online questionnaire that individuals filled out upon entering New Jersey to comply with the State’s quarantine for incoming travelers from areas with heavy COVID-19 spread.

### Challenge

To prevent the further spread of COVID-19, in June of 2020, Governor Murphy, along with the governors of New York and Connecticut, announced a travel advisory urging all individuals traveling from states with significant COVID-19 cases to quarantine for 14 days upon arrival.

### Innovation In Action

To help enforce the travel advisory, OOI developed an online form, accessible by email, text, or QR code, to centralize and organize the collection of information from thousands of individuals. That information was securely shared with the NJ Department of Health and the relevant local health department, which followed up with travelers regarding the quarantine.

### Impact \+ Metrics

* While the travel advisory was in effect, the Travel Quarantine Form enabled the State to efficiently collect more than 157,000 traveler registrations.

### Status

* On May 17, 2021, Governor Murphy lifted the State’s travel advisory and the form is no longer active.

### Key Partners

* NJ State Department of Health

title: Maternity Coverage Timeline Tool
initiative: Resident Experience Initiative
---

The [Maternity Coverage Timeline Tool](https://myleavebenefits.nj.gov/timeline) helps expecting parents plan when and how to use their family leave by providing a personalized calendar of how much leave time they have with State benefits. This work is part of the Resident Experience Initiative.

### Challenge

Most people who work in New Jersey qualify for paid leave benefits under Temporary Disability Insurance and Family Leave Insurance. However, to use these benefits, parents must navigate a complex application process, tracking multiple details and making calculations on their own, increasing the likelihood of making a mistake during the application process or delaying access to the benefit.

### Innovation In Action

Working closely with community partners and expecting parents to understand their needs, OOI saw an opportunity to use technology to simplify a confusing aspect of family leave and reduce stress. After asking parents a series of questions, the tool automatically provides start and end dates for leave based on their specific circumstances and preferences, giving parents clarity about the benefits they can access and when.

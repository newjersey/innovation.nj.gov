title: NJ Eviction and Homelessness Prevention Certification Form
initiative: COVID Response
---

The [COVID-19 Eviction Protection Tool](https://covid19.nj.gov/pages/renter) helps prevent low-income New Jerseyans from being evicted if they suffered economic hardships during the COVID-19 pandemic. The online self-certification tool helps users understand the protections they are eligible for and submit the necessary forms. 

### Challenge

In preparation for the end of the State's eviction moratorium, New Jersey introduced protections for low-income renters who struggled during the pandemic. Those who qualify can submit a self-certification form to their landlords, and those with pending legal actions against them can submit the form to NJ Courts.

### Innovation In Action

To ensure residents in need could stay in their homes, OOI created an easy-to-use online form that makes the process as seamless as possible. The interactive tool guides users through the process with a series of questions, automatically generates their self-certification form, and with back-end data sharing, users only need to fill out their information once and can share it with all relevant agencies.

### Impact + Metrics

-   As of April 2024, more than 85,000 residents have used the Eviction Protection Tool since its launch in 2021. 
-   The form was developed and launched in under eight weeks to ensure residents could get help on the first day the legislation establishing these protections took effect.
-   The lessons and tactics from this project formed the basis of OOIâ€™s approach to how it streamlines, simplifies, and improves how the State of New Jersey delivers key benefits and services to residents. 
-   This effort helped spur OOI to create the [Resident Experience Initiative](https://innovation.nj.gov/projects/resident-experience-initiative/), a multi-year effort to modernize State programs, benefits, and services, that is scaling to a number of other high priority program areas including housing and utility assistance, food security, worker benefits, and more. 

### Status

-   The tool remains active and continues to be updated as needed.

### Key Partners

-   NJ State Department of Community Affairs
-   NJ Courts

The Business.NJ.gov [Account](https://navigator.business.nj.gov/) is an interactive tool that provides entrepreneurs and businesses with personalized, step-by-step guides to planning, starting, and growing their company based on their specific industry. In addition, users can file several required forms and complete a growing number of transactions all through the tool.

### Challenge

Starting and operating a business in New Jersey requires navigating a complicated and fragmented process, bouncing from agency to agency, filing forms, providing redundant information, and creating multiple accounts. Prior to the Business.NJ.Gov Account, there was no digital tool that allowed businesses to discover what they needed to complete, and how they could go about doing it.

### Innovation In Action

With the user at the heart of every decision, OOI has transformed how businesses interact with NJ State government with a focus on ease and convenience. That means serving up all the information businesses need in a digestible, actionable format rather than placing the burden on businesses to search across multiple agencies. It also means streamlining policies and enabling data-sharing across agencies, so businesses can complete transactions without needing several accounts and individual forms from different agencies.

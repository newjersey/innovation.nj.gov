title: FundMyFuture Marketing Consultation + Creative Development
initiative: Communication + Engagement Lab
---

The C+E Lab worked with the Department of Labor and Workforce Development’s Lifelong Learning Account (LiLA) initiative team to develop and validate a product name that resonates with audiences as well as a website with information about the program and creative assets to help relaunch the program. 

### Challenge

The State of New Jersey was preparing to enroll eligible residents in a new, Lifelong Learning Account pilot program. But rather than promote the opportunity with an acronym (“LiLA”), the C+E Lab recommended conducting quantitative research to test different audience-friendly Apnames to identify the most effective option and validate that it is equitable in its appeal.

### Innovation In Action

To help the DOL program team ensure their product name appealed to their audience, the C+E Lab developed four name concepts and conducted a quantitative survey to identify the name that created the most awareness and intent, was believable, and equitable in its appeal. To support the outreach efforts, a microsite was developed to support three key audiences (LiLA training providers, the press, and New Jersey residents) by providing copy and design direction. A press release and new creative assets including customized flyers for each partner were developed to relaunch the program with program partners and the Fund My Future target audience. Direct outreach for the program was conducted by the C+E Lab to drive awareness and activate the target audience.

### Impact \+ Metrics

* Research uncovered a clear winning name, Fund My Future, that performed best across key attributes (Clarity, Relevance, Memorable, Believability, and Intent).  
* The winning name was proven to be clear in conveying its purpose, and created an emotional connection with the audience to the program’s mission.  
* The C+E Lab launched the Fund My Future microsite in April 2024, which aims to support the generation of 700 enrollments in the program.  
* The C+E Lab developed messaging was deployed to 10,000 people from the State Update list, driving 163 clicks to the three program partner pages.  
* As of June 2025, relaunch activities (press releases, customized partner flyers, and State list messaging deployment) are helping the program reach its qualified enrollee goals by its November 2025 deadline.

### Status

* The LiLA program was renamed to Fund My Future.   
* The microsite is live and entering the second year of its pilot.  
* In support of DOL’s efforts to re-introduce the program to constituents, the C+E Lab developed press releases, customized partner flyers, and deployed messaging through the State update list.  
* As of June 2025, the Fund My Future pilot is on track to reach its qualified enrollee goals by the November 2025 deadline.

title: FundMyFuture Marketing Consultation + Creative Development
initiative: Communication + Engagement Lab
---

The C+E Lab worked with the Department of Labor and Workforce Development’s Lifelong Learning Account (LiLA) initiative team to develop and validate a product name that resonates with audiences as well as a website with information about the program and creative assets to help relaunch the program. 

### Challenge
The State of New Jersey was preparing to enroll eligible residents in a new, $10 million Lifelong Learning Account pilot program. But rather than promote the opportunity with an acronym (“LiLA”), the C+E Lab recommended conducting quantitative research to test different audience-friendly names to identify the most effective option and validate that it is equitable in its appeal.

### Innovation In Action
To help the DOL program team ensure their product name appealed to their audience, the C+E Lab developed four name concepts and conducted a quantitative survey to identify the name that created the most awareness and intent, was believable, and equitable in its appeal. To support the outreach efforts, a microsite was developed to support three key audiences (LiLA training providers, the press, and New Jersey residents) by providing copy and design direction. New creative assets are in development to relaunch the program with the Fund My Future target audience.

### Impact + Metrics

-   Research uncovered a clear winning name, Fund My Future, that performed best across key attributes (Clarity, Relevance, Memorable, Believability, and Intent).
-   The winning name was proven to be clear in conveying its purpose, and created an emotional connection with our audience to the program’s mission.
-   The C+E Lab launched the Fund My Future microsite in April 2024.


### Status

-   The LiLA program was renamed to Fund My Future. 
- The microsite is live and entering the second year of its pilot.
- In support of DOL’s efforts to re-introduce the program to constituents, the C+E Lab is developing two sets of creative assets (emails, social, and banners) for DOL to deploy through partners.

title: Business.NJ.Gov Digital Marketing User Activation Campaign
initiative: Communication + Engagement Lab
---

The C+E Lab worked with the Business.NJ.gov team to develop and launch a digital marketing campaign designed to increase use of the site, drive awareness, and help accelerate outcomes.

### Challenge:

The Business.NJ.gov team relies on user testing and site data to inform their work. But traffic had plateaued on Business.NJ.Gov, limiting the platform’s impact with business owners, operators, and entrepreneurs throughout the state. The product team engaged the C+E Lab to increase users to the site, drive awareness, and help accelerate outcomes.

### Innovation In Action:

To help the Business.NJ.gov team reach and activate audiences, the C+E Lab developed an initial multi-channel campaign to increase site traffic and drive learnings. Expanding on the beta campaign’s impact, the C+E Lab conducted audience research to uncover insights about their motivations for a larger campaign. Using that insight, the C+E Lab developed a campaign to bring to life how Business.NJ.gov helps independent businesses succeed. The C+E Lab deployed a video-first approach to reach Business.NJ.gov’s audience on their preferred platform, with their preferred format, maximizing the campaign’s storytelling ability. The C+E Lab led the end-to-end campaign and has advanced  optimization strategies to maximize performance. Prior to the C+E Lab, the State would have needed to outsource these tasks to a marketing agency, but with the Lab, it now has those advanced capabilities in-house. To expand the impact of the campaign, the C+E Lab led the production of new native-Spanish-language assets for the campaign and partnered with the product team to develop “how to” and informational videos to live on Business.NJ.gov and help improve on-site performance. To better assess the impact of non-trackable media (such as streaming video), a lean-data approach was developed and tested to help validate the impact the paid media campaign creates for the target audience.

### Impact \+ Metrics

* Ethnographic research uncovered what business owners/operators and entrepreneurs really want from government is help so they (and their business) can succeed.  
* A communication strategy was developed to show how Business.NJ.gov helps independent business owners succeed.  
* A zip code model to identify members of underserved communities was developed, allowing the team to effectively reach, track and validate the efforts.  
* Insight-based creative was tested and validated to increase awareness, intent, believability, and equitable appeal.  
* As of the end of the campaign (March 2025), total users were up 10% year over year. Usage from members of underserved communities rose 23% year over year, and visits from Spanish-speaking users rose  more than 53% year over year. So these efforts are reaching audiences not traditionally reached through State channels and magnifying the site’s impact by expanding its reach.  
* A lean-data survey test provided data showing site users who saw an ad for Business.NJ.gov had higher positive perception scores than those who did not \- feeling more empowered, confident, knowledgeable. They also had a significantly higher Net Promoter Score, with 55%of those who saw an ad likely to recommend Business.NJ.gov.

### Status

* The paid media campaign ended February 2025\.  
* A new paid media campaign will launch September 2025, in which the C+E Lab will continue its work with the Business.NJ.gov team to promote its tools and better understand its audience, as well as drive guest user sessions.  
* The C+E Lab is leading the production of new Spanish-language assets for the campaign and is partnering with the product team to develop “how to” and informational videos to live on Business.NJ.gov and be tested for their ability to improve on-site performance.

title: Business.NJ.Gov Digital Marketing User Activation Campaign
initiative: Communication + Engagement Lab
---

The C+E Lab worked with the Business.NJ.gov team to develop and launch a digital marketing campaign designed to increase use of the site, drive awareness, and help accelerate outcomes.

### Challenge
Traffic had plateaued on Business.NJ.Gov, limiting the platform’s impact with business owners, operators, and entrepreneurs throughout the state. The product team engaged the C+E Lab to increase users to the site, drive awareness, and help accelerate outcomes.

### Innovation In Action
To help the Business.NJ.gov team reach and activate audiences, the C+E Lab conducted audience research to uncover insights about their motivations. Using that insight, a campaign was developed to bring to life how Business.NJ.gov helps independent businesses succeed. The C+E Lab deployed a video-first approach to reach Business.NJ.gov’s audience on their preferred platform, with their preferred format, maximizing the campaign’s storytelling ability. The C+E Lab led the end-to-end campaign and has advanced  optimization strategies to maximize performance.

initiative: Resident Experience Initiative

New Jersey’s Youth Mental Health Information Hub was being developed as a source of information for young adults struggling with mental health challenges. The site is intended to feature information in a simple, user-friendly format.

### Challenge

Even before the pandemic, young adults were faced with a mental health crisis which has only grown. Studies show mental health hospitalizations have increased significantly for children under age 19 over the last five years, and [suicide](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr73/nvsr73-04.pdf) is now the second leading cause of death for 10- to 24-year-olds. While the State has resources to help young adults, they are scattered across agency websites making them difficult to find, particularly in a moment of crisis.  

### Innovation In Action

Rather than relying on assumptions, OOI conducted surveys and worked with advocacy organizations to inform the Information Hub’s content and design. Surveys, learnings, and insights gathered through the research process informed how OOI identified, consolidated, and organized essential resources from multiple sites across government and service organizations.

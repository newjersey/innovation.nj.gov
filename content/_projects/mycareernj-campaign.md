title: My Career NJ Launch Campaign
initiative: Communication + Engagement Lab
---

In partnership with the New Jersey State Department of Labor (DOL), the C+E Lab is helping unemployed New Jerseyans change careers, gain new skills, and find jobs by connecting them with [My Career NJ](https://mycareer.nj.gov/), a new interactive digital hub created by DOL and the Office of Innovation that offers workers personalized career recommendations and training opportunities based on their unique skills and aspirations.  

### Challenge  

My Career NJ is a powerful new resource for unemployed New Jerseyans, but as a new resource few know about it and there is no shortage of training programs and job resources fighting to grab workers’ attention. So to ensure workers could benefit from My Career NJ’s innovative tools, DOL needed to cut through a crowded media landscape with a message that resonated with workers and ultimately drove them to use My Career NJ. 

### Innovation In Action

To help drive New Jersey workers to My Career NJ and its resources, the C+E Lab worked with DOL to launch a data-driven, research-backed marketing overhaul. In support of the My Career NJ paid media campaign, the C+E Lab synthesized existing research and interviews to determine audience segments, motivations, and key insights for campaign execution. Using these insights, creative concepts were developed and quantitatively tested to identify a winner and ensure it was equitable in its appeal. 

### Impact \+ Metrics

* My Career NJ was re-launched on March 2024 using C+E Lab language, driving over 16,000 users to the site in the first few days alone, which is more than half the users seen in the entire previous month.   
* Efforts have driven over 262,000 site visits.

### Status

* The C+E Lab continues to work closely with DOL in an advisory capacity to execute the paid media campaign, develop creative assets that will move residents to action, and optimize the campaign’s performance.   
* The My Career NJ media campaign launched in October 2024, will be expanded in April 2025 with the launch of streaming, paid social, and display media, and is scheduled to conclude in June 2025\.

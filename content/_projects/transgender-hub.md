The [Transgender Information Hub](http://transgender.nj.gov) is a central resource for the transgender and non-binary community in New Jersey that provides guidance and answers to common questions. The site features critical information from nearly a dozen agencies in a supportive, user-friendly format.

### Challenge:
 For transgender and non-binary New Jerseyans, basic actions like updating a name or gender marker on official documents can be unexpectedly challenging and potentially traumatizing. Antiquated policies required individuals to get medical documentation and navigate a complex web of local, state, and federal requirements. The Governor and the Legislature passed new laws to remove these barriers and protect the privacy of transgender individuals, however outdated information continues to circulate online. Yet, without a central source of information, transgender and non-binary individuals still needed to sift through multiple state agencies and departments to obtain basic services.

### Innovation In Action:
 To ensure the needs of transgender and non-binary New Jerseyans were met, OOI used a data-driven and user-centered approach by first conducting a user-needs survey to understand the most pressing needs and concerns. OOI partnered with advocacy and service-based organizations throughout the state to both amplify the survey, and gain insights. Additionally, numerous user-testing sessions further informed the site’s content and design. Rather than a static website, the Transgender Information Hub’s design, organization, and content continues to be updated based on user data and feedback to better serve residents.

### Impact + Metrics

- For the first time, transgender New Jerseyans have a government resource dedicated to simplifying critical services and no longer need to spend hours visiting multiple sites.
- As of April 2024, the Transgender Information Hub has been visited more than 53,000 times and connected these visitors to critical information and services. 

### Status

- In early 2023, a beta version of the Transgender Information Hub was launched, and is currently undergoing user-testing and further refinement based on feedback.
- In collaboration with the Governor’s Outreach Team, OOI developed a trifold brochure to distribute to community partners for a promotional campaign for Trans Day of Visibility in 2024.

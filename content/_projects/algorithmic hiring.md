title: Algorithmic Hiring Education Initiative
initiative: Data + Policy
---

At the recommendation of the Future Of Work Task Force, OOI worked with Rutgers University to advise the NJ Office of the Attorney General, Division on Civil Rights (DCR) on the risks of algorithmic hiring tools that can inadvertently introduce discrimination and limit diversity in hiring.

### Challenge

In an effort to reduce individual biases, employers often rely on algorithms to help make hiring decisions, screen candidates, and even administer interviews. However, studies have found that these algorithms may actually reinforce existing biases, penalizing candidates who identify as women, people of color, or those with disabilities, as well as those who attended certain schools or dress in a certain way.

### Innovation In Action

OOI deployed a research-backed and multi-disciplinary approach to exploring this area, while also tapping outside experts and academia to deepen the State’s understanding of the public policy challenges that algorithmic hiring tools present.

### Impact \+ Metrics

* OOI’s research helped inform Rutgers activities as well as DCR’s rulemaking process in 2024\.

### Status

* OOI worked with DCR and Rutgers University to advise on best practices pertaining to the use of AI decision making tools with NJ HR professionals.  
* In January 2025, DCR released extensive [guidance on algorithmic discrimination](https://www.nj.gov/oag/newsreleases25/2025-0108_DCR-Guidance-on-Algorithmic-Discrimination.pdf), outlining how businesses should comply with the NJ Law Against Discrimination when using algorithmic decision systems. The guidance addresses the use of AI tools for hiring.

title: Direct File Uptake Campaign
initiative: Communication + Engagement Lab
---

The Communication and Engagement Lab worked with the Resident Experience Initiative team to create awareness of residents’ new ability to file taxes directly \- and for free \- with the government and drive traffic to the new [DirectFile.NJ.gov landing page.](http://DirectFile.NJ.gov)

### Challenge

The ability to file taxes directly \- and for free \- was new to New Jersey residents in 2025\. Research showed that while some people were open to filing directly with government, others were not. Messaging would need to work hard to encourage people \- including intermittent filers \- to explore a newer, simpler way to file. 

### Innovation In Action

To reach and activate the Direct File target audience, the C+E Lab developed messaging approaches to reach both audiences that were open to and even excited about filing directly, as well as those that were “loyal” to a preexisting method of filing and resistant to change. The messaging was tested quantitatively to identify the option that drove the highest intent. The winning message provided the foundation for an outreach toolkit that was developed and distributed through State agency, department, and community partners.

### Impact \+ Metrics

* As of August 2025, 83% of traffic to DirectFile.NJ.gov came from the C+E Lab's toolkit outreach campaign.   
* In its first year, over 8,600 New Jerseyans used Direct File as of August 2025\.   
* 97% of users surveyed said they were “satisfied” or “very satisfied” with their filing experience and 92% prefer Direct File to their previous filing method. 94% thought that the data transfer from federal to state was “seamless and quick.”

title: Business.NJ.gov Live Chat
initiative: Business Experience Initiative
---

The Business.NJ.gov Live Chat feature connects users in real-time with customer service representatives and experts from several different agencies who are on-hand to answer their business-related questions.

### Challenge

Multiple State departments and agencies are responsible for administering critical business transactions. Prior to the Live Chat, when a business had a question or needed help, they had to call multiple State agencies with long wait times before getting answers -- a process many found difficult and frustrating.

### Innovation In Action

OOI partnered with the Business Action Center and other departments to centralize a fragmented customer service experience, cutting red tape by directly connecting businesses to relevant customer support. The service not only improves the experience for business customers, but also enables agency staff to serve more residents with greater efficiency by reducing call volume.

### Impact + Metrics

-  In 2023, the Live Chat saw a 32% increase in the number of businesses seeking answers, and as of April 2024, the Live Chat has enabled more than 130,000 virtual conversations between businesses and experts at the State’s Business Action Center, the Department of Treasury, the Department of Labor, and the State’s Economic Development Authority.

### Status

-   Based on user testing and data, OOI is continuing to improve the Live Chat feature offering more capabilities and offerings to ensure businesses can get the help they need.

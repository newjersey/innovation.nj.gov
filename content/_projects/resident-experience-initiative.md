The Resident Experience Initiative (ResX) is streamlining, simplifying, and improving how New Jersey State government delivers benefits and services to residents through the use of agile methodologies and human-centered design. The initiative is an expansion of efforts during the COVID-19 pandemic to use innovative approaches to help the public find vaccine appointments, secure protection from eviction during economic hardship, and connect with vital programs and services.

### Challenge

Whether it’s accessing health insurance through NJ FamilyCare, obtaining nutritional food benefits through SNAP, or finding meaningful employment through the State’s multitude of workforce programs, millions of New Jerseyans interact with the State government in person, on the phone, and online to receive benefits and support. While these benefits and services are impactful, the process to access critical support is often long, complex, and confusing. Bureaucratic silos, complex processes, and hard-to-reach customer service are significant barriers that disproportionately hinder the State’s most vulnerable from accessing benefits.

### Innovation In Action

The Resident Experience Initiative puts residents and their experience at the center of all design, engineering, policy, and implementation considerations. Using extensive user research, cross-agency collaboration, and agile development, ResX works to tangibly improve the lives of residents. At a high level, ResX also advances uniform standards across government, shared digital services, and the creation of cross-agency one-stop websites.

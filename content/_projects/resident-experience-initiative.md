The Resident Experience Initiative (ResX) is an ongoing effort aimed at streamlining, simplifying, and improving how the State delivers key benefits and services to residents through the use of agile methodologies and human-centered design. ResX and its projects grew out of the innovative approaches used during the pandemic to help residents get vaccine appointments, prevent evictions, and connect with other vital programs and services.

### Challenge

Millions of New Jerseyans interact with the State government in person, on the phone, and online to receive benefits and support. While these benefits and services are crucial, the steps to access them can be long, complex, or confusing, discouraging some eligible residents from applying. Bureaucratic silos, complex processes, and hard-to-reach customer service are significant barriers that disproportionately hinder the State’s most vulnerable from accessing benefits.

### Innovation In Action

The Resident Experience Initiative puts residents and their experience at the center of all design, engineering, policy, and implementation considerations. Using extensive user research, cross-agency collaboration, and agile development, ResX projects work to tangibly improve the lives of residents. ResX also advances uniform standards, shared digital services, and replicable platform tools.

### Impact \+ Metrics

- OOI, in partnership with the Department of Agriculture and several other agencies, used machine learning to identify over 200,000 additional eligible children to automatically receive summer nutrition benefits in 2024 and 2025\. 
- In partnership with the Department of Labor, OOI launched a completely redesigned application for [Unemployment Insurance](/projects/nj-ui/) with 20% fewer questions. On average, the previous application took 3 hours and 50 minutes to submit. With the new application, half of applicants submitted theirs in less than 25 minutes. As of August 2025, 90% of applicants now finish and submit on the same day.
- In partnership with a number of agencies, OOI has transitioned 13 legacy call centers to cloud-based systems powered by AI, enabling residents to get help more quickly and improving efficiency for those agencies. As of August 2025, the new system has helped reduce wait times from over 40 minutes to under two minutes across several agencies. This has supported a 6 to 15 percent increase in the number of callers who actually talk to an agent, while also roughly cutting costs in half.
- OOI, in partnership with the Department of Labor, created a [Maternity Coverage Timeline Tool](/projects/maternity-coverage-tool/), so expecting parents can receive a personalized calendar to help them plan when and how to take their maternity leave. As of August 2025, more than 170,000 New Jerseyans have used the Maternity Coverage Timeline Tool to understand their benefits, and more than 900,000 timelines have been created since the tool launched in May 2022\.
- OOI worked with the Department of Labor to build and launch [My Career NJ](https://mycareer.nj.gov/) in March 2024, an interactive digital hub that centralizes personalized career resources. The hub features two tools: the NJ Training Explorer and the NJ Career Navigator. The Training Explorer enables customized filtering of training programs, provides information on tuition assistance, and gives users valuable insight into the providers that offer programs that meet their skill-building needs. The Career Navigator leverages big data and machine learning to generate personalized job and career recommendations that align with each user’s skill set, employment history, and individual professional goals across a wide range of private and public employment sectors. The resource has been visited more than 1.5 million times to get personalized career recommendations and find training programs, online classes, and other upskilling opportunities that fit residents' unique needs and goals.
- To provide much-needed guidance and support for transgender and non-binary New Jerseyans, OOI partnered with advocacy and service-based organizations to launch [Transgender.NJ.gov](/projects/transgender-hub/), a resource hub with relevant information from nearly a dozen agencies. As of August 2025, the Transgender Information Hub has been visited more than 118,000 times and connected these visitors to critical information and services.
- Working with the Office of the Secretary for Higher Education, OOI launched [BasicNeeds.NJ.gov](https://basicneeds.nj.gov) to support low-income college students in accessing nutrition, housing, and other resources to address challenges that could end their academic pursuits. As of August 2025, BasicNeeds.NJ.gov has been visited more than 113,000 times, providing these visitors with critical information and resources.

title: Innovation Skills Accelerator
---

The New Jersey Innovation Skills Accelerator is a free, online program to train public officials to leverage new technology and data to drive innovation in their day-to-day work, and tap into the intelligence and expertise of residents of the Garden State. The program includes video instruction, interviews with leading public sector innovators from around the world, readings, and self-assessments to help public entrepreneurs work differently. Course content spans an array of subject areas, including introductions to new technologies like blockchain and big data analytics, utilizing modern methodologies like user-centered design and open innovation, and employing experimental design approaches.

In addition to being freely available to all State government employees, the Innovation Skills Accelerator's online content is also publicly accessible, with the hope that county and local governments across the Garden State - as well as states and municipalities across the country and the world - will also find the trainings helpful.

The Office of Innovation also works with agency partners to create bespoke  innovation skills programming. For example, the Office of Innovation and the New Jersey Attorney General’s Office hosted “Governance Innovation for Government Lawyers, Regulators, and Law Enforcement” (May 2022). Thirty-seven participants from 17 divisions, offices, and commissions spent two days learning about new technologies such as big data, artificial intelligence, machine learning, predictive analytics and collective intelligence, and their applications for work in the Attorney General's Office, discussing how new technologies can be used to create more effective policies and services for residents and exploring opportunities for new data and innovation projects within the Office of the Attorney General.

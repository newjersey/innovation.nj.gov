title: Business.NJ.Gov
initiative: Business Experience Initiative

[Business.NJ.Gov](https://business.nj.gov/) is a "first-stop" website with all the information businesses need to start, operate, and grow in New Jersey. Developed as part of the [Business Experience Initiative]({{ site.baseurl }}/content/projects/business-experience-initiative.html), the site features a comprehensive range of content on everything from regulations to funding opportunities, hiring procedures to licensing, and more.

### Challenge

Prior to Business.NJ.gov, information that businesses needed was organized by government agency rather than by use-case. This forced business owners to dig through more than 15 State websites to find the specific information they were seeking.

### Innovation In Action

To modernize how businesses interact with the State, OOI has employed a data-informed, user-first design philosophy. In practice, that means OOI has focused on streamlining a fragmented system by organizing information and processes around how businesses actually use them rather than keeping related processes siloed within each State agency or department. Continuous and deliberate engagement with the end users -- New Jersey businesses and aspiring entrepreneurs -- is a key part of the process.

### Impact + Metrics

-   Rather than sifting through multiple websites, companies can now easily find the answer to any question they have, file critical forms, and get personalized recommendations -- all in one convenient place.
-   In 2022, more than 850,000 people used Business.NJ.gov to get the information they needed.

### Status

-   OOI continues to consolidate thousands of fragmented forms to make them submittable through a "one-stop shop" and automate processes across agencies.
-   Business.NJ.gov is continually being updated with additional content and information driven by user feedback, data, and quantitative A/B testing of design and content.

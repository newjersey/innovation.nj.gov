title: Fund My Future
initiative: Data + Policy
---

In one of the nation’s first pilot programs of its kind, Fund My Future provides residents with unrestricted funds for job training, education, career coaching, job search assistance, and wraparound services such as childcare, eldercare, transportation to training, and more. The pilot is modeled on the [Future of Work Task Force’s Lifelong Learning Accounts pilot recommendation](https://fowtf.innovation.nj.gov/roadmap-and-recommendations.html). 

### Challenge

Disruptive new technologies are changing the economy, eliminating the need for some jobs while creating new ones altogether. To adapt, workers need new skills, which require training and education. Research from the [Future of Work Task Force](https://fowtf.innovation.nj.gov/resources.html) found that many workers lack access to training, and many employers do not provide or fund significant training opportunities. Workers also face additional barriers to accessing training, such as limited financial resources to pay for child or eldercare that would be required for them to participate in upskilling or training programs outside of work.

### Innovation In Action

Unlike many assistance programs, Fund My Future enables residents to focus resources on overcoming the barriers specific to their lives. Research has shown that allowing individuals to manage spending decisions, rather than the government, creates the greatest impact. Residents in need of up-skilling later in their careers are more likely to have families and other financial obligations and time commitments that make training more difficult. By allowing residents to use funds for wrap-around services like childcare, this program enables a broader pool of the workforce to engage in up-skilling.

### Impact \+ Metrics

* Governor Murphy and the Legislature set aside $10 million to create this first-of-its-kind pilot for qualifying New Jerseyans who are long-term unemployed or employed residents that qualify as Asset Limited Income Constrained.  
* The pilot launched in June 2023\. As of August 2024, more than 200 residents participated in the program across the State, resulting in the creation of personalized individualized education programs (IEPs), and financial support for training, nutrition, healthcare, and transportation needs. 

### Status

* The Office of Innovation’s C+E Lab is currently partnering with DOL and its partners to support the relaunch of the program to residents throughout NJ.

title: NJ Eviction Moratorium Information + Question Form
initiative: COVID Response
---

The NJ Eviction Moratorium Information + Question Form was an interactive form that helped renters and homeowners determine what protections were available to them during the pandemic.

### Challenge

As the pandemic ground the economy to a halt in March 2020, more than 800,000 New Jersey workers suddenly found themselves without jobs or a way to pay their rent. The threat of eviction loomed over hundreds of thousands of households, and policymakers feared a homelessness crisis on an unprecedented scale.

### Innovation In Action

OOI created an online tool that helped prevent low-income New Jerseyans from being evicted if they suffered economic hardships during the COVID-19 pandemic by learning their rights and discovering relevant rules and regulations. A resident could input information about their specific situation, and the interactive form provided information tailored to the resident’s specific situation. It also allowed users to submit questions to DCA about their specific situations in a streamlined manner.

### Impact + Metrics

-   The form facilitated more than 2,500 constituent inquiries to the Department of Community Affairs.

### Status

-   The tool was replaced with the NJ Eviction and Homelessness Prevention Certification Form, which was built when the State’s eviction moratorium ended.

### Key Partners

-   Office of the Governor
-   NJ State Department of Community Affairs

title: C+E Lab Playbook
initiative: Communication + Engagement Lab
---

To help government agencies better connect residents to critical programs through marketing campaigns, the C+E Lab has created a [step-by-step playbook](https://innovation.nj.gov/cel-playbook/) that teaches public sector employees how to use data, research, and other proven best practices from modern consumer marketing. The Playbook walks readers through the C+E Lab’s process to uncover and validate an approach that moves audiences to act \- whether they are a communications director, program manager, developer, product manager, or public policy practitioner. 

### Challenge

The State of New Jersey spends significant amounts of funds each year on advertising, yet government employees often lack the time or training to deploy the tools, social and behavioral research, and data-driven insights that make for truly effective marketing campaigns. As a result, campaigns may not be as effective or efficient as they could be, leaving residents unaware of the programs or services available to assist them or unmotivated to use those programs or services. 

### Innovation In Action

To equip busy government employees with the skills they need to run effective modern marketing campaigns, the C+E Lab has broken down its proven methodology into a free, easy to follow playbook. To accommodate government workers’ busy schedules, the C+E Lab boiled down each component of its process into condensed “Do It In A Day” snippets so anyone can try the methodology. Checklists, templates, and guides accompany the text to help readers apply the methods presented. There is also guidance on how long each aspect takes and recommendations on how to complete each step with limited time. Whether public sector workers follow the full process from start-to-finish, or cherry pick components to try, the tools and tools and techniques in the Playbook will help government agencies better connect with their constituents and move them to action.

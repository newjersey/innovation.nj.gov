title: Transportation Needs Index
initiative: Data + Policy
---

Policy leaders and decisionmakers in New Jersey need to be able to easily understand local data in order to find areas that would benefit from new kinds of transit solutions. OOI and the Department of Environmental Protection teamed up to create a new index that is helping inform those discussions.

### Challenge

In recent years, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection has seen the number and types of innovative “eMobility” transportation solutions continue to grow. New and revitalized modes including carshares, microtransit, bikeshares, and shuttle services can provide cleaner, more affordable, and reliable transportation options. 

With this backdrop, investments in eMobility need to be informed by a robust set of data and tools that help with decisionmaking in collaboration with on-the-ground community groups. 

### Innovation In Action

The project team searched for innovative approaches to this challenge and identified the Jersey City on the Move transportation study as a promising framework. They modified and built off that approach, while also soliciting additional feedback from transportation planning professionals. 

The team found and analyzed multiple data sources, including disability status, vehicle access, poverty levels, age demographics, and population density along with proximity to bus stops and rail stations. With this data, NJDEP then created a data visualization that helps identify communities where transportation investments could have the greatest impact.

This Transportation Needs Index now serves as a data-driven analysis tool to identify areas where high needs intersect with limited transit access. The interactive map lets users view demographic needs, transit access, and overburdened community layers across New Jersey, with options to explore individual scores and combined priority areas. By exclusively using publicly available data sources and openly sharing the methodology, the index creates an initial foundation for others to build on. 


### Impact \+ Metrics

* NJDEP is using the Transportation Needs Index to help inform upcoming public engagements in which local transportation needs are discussed.This Community Transportation Needs Assessment initiative is tapping local leaders to conduct on-the-ground engagements, and the index is a key resource to help guide efforts at the local level.  
* As of August 2025, the Index and related Story Map and App have been accessed over 2,000 times since their launch in March 2025.

### Status

* The Transportation Needs Index will continue to evolve as the team receives new ideas and feedback to enhance it.

## About This Playbook

**The greatest gift you can give your audience is understanding what they really care about.**

This Playbook is produced by the New Jersey State Office of Innovation’s Communication + Engagement Lab (the C+E Lab) to help you better connect your audience to your program. We’ve documented our step-by-step process to help you uncover and validate an approach that will move your audience to act — whether you're a communications director, program manager, developer, product manager or public policy practitioner.

### The Big Picture

We are inundated by voices constantly fighting to grab our attention. For a message to cut through, it needs to speak directly to what we most care about. If a message fails to resonate it will be ignored.

## About the C+E Lab

The C+E Lab’s mission is to better connect New Jersey residents with State programs, services and initiatives.

We do this by using consumer marketing best practices to bring a resident-first approach to government communication.

A resident-first approach changes how we talk to our audience, from the things we think are important to what residents really care about.
We start by conducting research to understand resident motivations. We then use the findings to articulate the true value for the resident with messaging and craft strategies to meet residents where they are – and move them to action.

Our messaging is validated before launch, which means we go to market with messaging that has been proven as most effective. We scale the impact of our live campaigns using the strategies and tactics that are proven to drive results.

Our process outlined here so you can follow it, too.

## What's Inside

This Playbook is your how-to guide to incorporating a resident-first communication approach into your practice. It lays out the entire marketing process from insight to optimization. You can follow the process in its entirety or experiment with incorporating parts of it ad hoc.

For each part of the process we tell you what you need to know to start doing this work:

1. Why it matters
2. How it works
3. How long it takes

Not everyone has the time to go through the full process. That’s why we boiled down each component to Do It in a Day so anyone can try the methodology out.

Mission-critical pieces of information are called out as Red Flags, and more advanced applications of the process are noted as Pro Tips.

<p class="usa-intro">The Office of Innovation partners with State departments and agencies to design, develop, and improve government products and services to ensure they are more effective, more efficient, and more responsive to the needs of New Jerseyans.
</p>

## How We Work

The Office of Innovation uses modern, data-driven, human-centered, and agile processes to help  Garden State residents and businesses access and benefit from State programs and services. We do this by deploying cross-functional teams that leverage data, design, engineering, policy, product, and communications expertise. Our teams place the resident at the center of our problem-solving process, work with our partners to better understand problems, and then iteratively solve those problems to deliver value and impact to the New Jerseyans we serve. 

## Our Projects

Since our creation, we have engaged in dozens of high-impact projects, including:

- Modernizing benefit programs to enable agencies to efficiently serve millions, while saving residents hundreds of thousands of hours and reducing agency costs by millions of dollars.
- Building new tools that have helped millions of residents access and use benefits, find job training programs, get a COVID-19 vaccine appointment, find rental assistance, sign up for business grants, and more.
- Launching information hubs that have helped millions of New Jerseyans conveniently find critical information on job training resources, COVID-19 health guidance, youth mental health, support for the transgender and non-binary community, and more.
- Designing campaigns that have reached millions, encouraging residents to finish their college degree, get help with their business, and more.
- Advising on policy innovations in areas that affect every New Jerseyan including the future of work itself, artificial intelligence, economic development, workforce training, and more.
